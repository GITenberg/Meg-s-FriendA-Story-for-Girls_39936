<h2>MEG'S FRIEND.</h2>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>MEG.</h3>


<p>It was a queer old house in Bloomsbury, that had
been fashionable some two hundred years ago, and
had fallen into abject neglect. The hall door was
dim for want of paint, and weatherbeaten to a
dirty gray; the lower windows were tawdry with
vulgar blinds and curtains, and enlivened with
green boxes full of a few pining flowers. The
drawing-room windows showed a sort of mildewed
finery, and then, in melancholy degrees, poverty
claimed the upper stories. It had all the features
and cast of a London lodging house.</p>

<p>Within, the house carried out the same suggestion
of past grandeur and present decay. The hall was
wide, dingy, and unfurnished; the staircase of oak
was impressive, stained, and dusty.</p>

<p>On the topmost step of the top flight might
habitually be seen, toward sunset, a child seated
and watching, with head thrust through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
banisters. She would sit still until there came the
scrape of a latchkey turning in the lock, and the
sound of footsteps in the hall. Then the mute little
figure would grow full of sudden life; the little feet
would run down faster than eye could mark. Arrived
in the hall, the child would stop with sudden
dignity before a man, robust and tall, and looking
up, ever so high, into a bright, young, manly face
smiling down upon her, she would lift her tiny
forefinger, and some such colloquy would ensue:</p>

<p>"You are late; where have you been, Mr. Standish?"</p>

<p>"At work, Meg&mdash;at work all the time."</p>

<p>"You have not been to the parlor of the Dragon?"</p>

<p>"No, Meg; not set my foot inside it."</p>

<p>"You have not been with those horrid whisky-smelling
men?"</p>

<p>"Not seen one of them, Meg."</p>

<p>"Then you may come up," the child would say,
taking his hand and leading him up.</p>

<p>Mr. William Standish was beginning life as a
journalist. He contributed descriptive articles to
a London paper, and was correspondent to a colonial
journal. His straight-featured countenance expressed
energy and decision; his glance betokened a
faculty of humorous and rapid observation; closely
cropped blond hair covered his shapely head.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The journalist occupied the rooms on the upper
story of Mrs. Browne's lodging-house. He was the
single member of the nomadic population sheltering
under that decaying roof who lived among his
household gods. He had made it a stipulation, on
taking the rooms, that he should have them unfurnished,
and he had banished every trace of the
landlady's belongings.</p>

<p>The child was Meg. She went by no other name.
When Mrs. Browne answered her lodgers' queries
concerning her, she replied vaguely that the child
had been left in her charge. Meg went to an over-crowded
school in the morning, and did odd jobs
of household work in the afternoon. In the intervals
she sat on the topmost stair, watching the
social eddies of the shabby miniature world breaking
down below. She was a silent child, with a
mop of dark brown hair and gray eyes, the gaze of
which was so sustained as not to be always pleasant
to meet. The gravity of her look was apt to make
those upon whom it was directed feel foolish. She
repelled the patronizing advances of lodgers, and,
when compelled to answer, chilled conversation by
the appalling straightforwardness of her monosyllabic
replies.</p>

<p>Two events had influenced her childhood. One
day, when she was about seven years of age, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
had suddenly asked the old servant, who from time
immemorial had been the sole assistant of Mrs.
Browne in discharging her duties toward her
lodgers:</p>

<p>"Tilly, had you a mammy?"</p>

<p>"Lor' bless the child!" answered Tilly, almost
losing hold of the plate she was washing. "Of
course I had."</p>

<p>"Has every child got a mammy?" persisted Meg,
with deliberate plainness of speech.</p>

<p>"Of course they have," answered the old woman,
utterly bewildered.</p>

<p>"Is madam my mammy?" asked the child, a
slight tremor perceptible in the slower and deeper
intonation of her voice.</p>

<p>"Madam" was the name by which she had been
taught to call Mrs. Browne.</p>

<p>"No!" answered Tilly sharply; "and if you ask
any more questions ye'll be put into the dark closet."</p>

<p>The threat, that brought to the child's mind
associations of terror, wrought the desired effect of
silence. She stood, with her glance unflinchingly
directed on Tilly's face, and with a question trembling
on her lips, until the old servant turned away
and left the kitchen.</p>

<p>Hitherto Meg had never asked a question concerning
herself. She had accepted a childhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
without kissings and pettings&mdash;a snubbed, ignored
childhood&mdash;with a child's sainted powers of patience
and resignation.</p>

<p>That night, as the old woman was composing
herself to sleep in the attic that she shared with the
child, she was startled by Meg's voice sounding
close to her ear, and, turning, she saw the diminutive
figure standing near her bed in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Tilly," she said, "I don't mind your locking
me up in the dark closet, if you'll just tell me&mdash;is
my mammy dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tilly, taken off her guard.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, and an audible sigh.</p>

<p>"I'll never be naughty again, Tilly&mdash;never," resumed
the child's voice, "if you'll just tell me&mdash;what
was she like?"</p>

<p>"You'll not ask another question if I tell ye?"
replied Tilly after a moment of silent self-debate.</p>

<p>"No, Tilly."</p>

<p>"Never another? Do ye hear?"</p>

<p>"Never, Tilly," repeated the child solemnly.</p>

<p>"And you'll never let madam know as I told
you?" said Tilly excitedly, sitting up in her bed.</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Then, I don't mind saying, for I thinks as you
ought to know, as she was as pretty as a picture as
I ever saw, and the gentlest, sweetest, ladiest lady,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
said Tilly, nodding, as a sharp sob sounded in her
throat.</p>

<p>"Lady?" said Meg.</p>

<p>"A lady she was in all her ways, every bit of her;
and the man as let her die here all alone was a brute&mdash;that
he was!" said Tilly, with vehemence.</p>

<p>"What man?" asked the child, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Go to bed," said Tilly severely, through her
sobs.</p>

<p>"Was it my pappy?" said the child, who had seen
and heard strange things during her seven-years'
life.</p>

<p>"Go to bed," repeated Tilly. "You promised as
you'd never ask another question."</p>

<p>"I will not, Tilly," said Meg, turning away, and
returning through the moonlight to bed.</p>

<p>The child kept her word, and never alluded to the
subject again to Tilly.</p>

<p>A few days later, when she was helping the old
servant to tidy the rooms after the departure of
some lodgers from the drawing-room floor, Tilly
was surprised by the eagerness with which she
craved permission to keep a crumpled fashion-plate
that she had found among the litter. It represented
a simpering young woman in a white ball
dress, decked with roses. Permission having been
granted her to appropriate the work of art, Meg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
carried it up to her attic, and hid it away in a box.
Had any one cared to observe the child, it would
have been remarked that she, who kissed nobody,
lavished kisses upon this meaningless creation of a
dressmakers' brain; gazed at it, murmured to it,
hid it away, and slept with it under her pillow.</p>

<p>The next great event marking Meg's childhood
had been the arrival of Mr. William Standish to the
lodging-house. It had occurred nearly two years
after the talk with Tilly concerning her mother.
Meanwhile the old servant had died.</p>

<p>Meg had watched with interest the arrival of the
new lodger's properties; and she had listened, fascinated,
to his lusty voice, singing to the accompaniment
of hammering, and rising above the flurry of
settling down.</p>

<p>On the third evening Mr. Standish, who had
observed the little figure cowering in the dusk, and
had once or twice given to it a friendly nod, invited
her to enter. Meg held back a moment, then shyly
walked in.</p>

<p>She had a general impression of books and writing
materials, pipes, and prints on all sides, and of
an atmosphere impregnated with the perfume of
tobacco.</p>

<p>After another pause of smileless hesitation, she
took the footstool her host drew for her by the fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
At his invitation she told him her name, and gave
a succinct account of her general mode of life. She
admitted, with monosyllabic brevity, that she liked
to hear him sing, and that it would please her if he
would sing for her now. She sat entranced and
forgetful of her surroundings as he warbled:</p>

<p>
<span class="i2">"Nellie was a lady&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">Last night she died,"</span>
</p>

<p>and followed the negro ballad with a spirited rendering
of the "Erl King."</p>

<p>At his invitation she renewed her visits. She
was tremendously impressed when he told her that
he wrote for the papers; and was dumb with
amazement when he showed her, in a newspaper, the
printed columns of which he was the author.</p>

<p>They had been acquainted about a week, when
Meg broke the silence set upon her lips, and spoke
to her new friend as she had never spoken to human
being before.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish had recited for her the ballad of the
ghostly mother who nightly comes to visit the children
she has left on earth, and till cock-crow rocks
the cradle of her sleeping baby. The young man
was astonished at the expression of the child. Her
cheeks were pale; she breathed hard; her round
opened eyes were fixed upon him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish mother would come just like that to me,"
she said abruptly.</p>

<p>"Your mother&mdash;is she dead?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>She nodded. "She's dead. I never saw her&mdash;never.
I'd love to see her just a-coming and standing
by my bed. I'd not be a bit frightened."</p>

<p>"But if you have never seen her you would not
know she was your mother," he replied, impressed
by the passionate assertion of her manner.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd know her! I'd know her!" said the
child, with vivid assurance. "Soon as she'd come in
I'd know her. She was a lady."</p>

<p>"A lady!" he repeated. "How do you know?
What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Tilly told me. Tilly's dead," answered Meg
with ardor. "She told it to me once before; and
I went to see her at the hospital, and she said it
again. She said, 'Meg, your mother was a lady&mdash;the
sweetest, prettiest, ladiest lady'&mdash;that's what
she said; 'and, Meg, be good for her sake.'" She
paused, her eyes continuing to hold his with excited
conviction. "That's how I know she was a lady,"
Meg resumed; "and I know what a lady is. The
Misses Grantums down there"&mdash;infusing scorn into
her voice as she pointed to the floor to indicate she
meant lodgers who lived below&mdash;"they're not
ladies though they've fine dresses; but they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
loud voices, and they scold. I go to the corners of
the streets. I watch the carriages. I see the ladies
in them; and when I see one gentle and a-smiling
like an angel, I say mother was like one of these.
That's how I'd know what she'd be like. And,"
she added more slowly, lowering her voice to a confidential
whisper and advancing a step, "I have a
picture of her. Would you like to see it?"</p>

<p>"I would," he answered, thinking that at last he
was approaching a clew to the mystery.</p>

<p>She dashed off, and in a moment returned with
something carefully wrapped up in tissue paper,
and gently drew out a limp picture, that she held
out at arm's length before the young man, keeping
it out of his reach.</p>

<p>"There, I'm sure she'd be like that&mdash;all smiling,
you see. And those beautiful curls, are they not
lovely? and those large eyes and those roses?
I'm sure she'd be just like that."</p>

<p>"But let me hold it&mdash;just with my finger tips,"
he pleaded, as the child jealously held the print
away from him.</p>

<p>She slowly relinquished it to him and stood at
his elbow.</p>

<p>"That's a picture taken out of a book&mdash;not a
portrait," he said.</p>

<p>"I picked it up. Some lodgers had gone away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
I found it in a corner. Isn't it lovely? I'm sure
she'd be just like that," reiterated Meg.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish was silent a moment. He was
moved, yet he felt impelled to speak words of
wisdom to the child. Mooning about corners of
streets watching ladies drive past, and nursing those
queer, foolish, ambitious ideas about her mother was
not likely to lead to any good. He thought the
whole story was probably without a grain of truth,
the absurd fabrication of some old woman's brain,
and likely to prove hurtful to Meg in giving her
false notions concerning her duties in life.</p>

<p>He paused, revolving his words, anxious not to
hurt, yet deeming it incumbent upon him to expel
this foolish fancy.</p>

<p>"My dear child," he said at last, "why do you
imagine your mother was like that picture, or like
one of those ladies in the carriages? For all you
know they may be lazy, vain, and selfish. It is
not the pretty dress that makes the lady, or the
face either. Is it not far better and more reasonable
to think of that dear mother, whom you never
saw, as one of God's own ladies? These ladies are
found in all sorts of conditions, sometimes in caps
and aprons, sometimes in beautiful bonnets, very
often with brave, rough hands. What is wanted
to make a lady is a kind, honest heart."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, that's not being a lady," interrupted the
child, with a flash and a toss of her head. She
spoke with decision; but her voice faltered as if she
had received a shock. Taking the picture from the
young man's hand, she began carefully, and with a
trembling elaborateness, to replace it in its coverings.
"Jessie's good, and so was Tilly. They
work hard, and scrub, and run about on errands.
They're not ladies. A lady's quite different," continued
Meg, suddenly facing him and speaking with
vehemence and clearness. "She's rich, and never
scolds or cheats. She does not work at all&mdash;not a
bit; people work for her and drive her about, but
she does nothing herself. She has never dirty
hands, or her cap all untidy, or looking all in a fuss.
She does nothing but smile and look beautiful, like
an angel," concluded Meg triumphantly, reiterating
her favorite simile.</p>

<p>"Meg," said the young fellow, seeing more clearly
the necessity to root out this absurd ideal from the
child's mind, "you are talking very foolishly. A
lady is, indeed, not necessarily an angel. You say
a lady must be rich. Now, if your mother was rich,
why are you poor? Would she not have left you
her money in dying, and you would have been rich
like her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
child, growing a little pale, and beginning once
more to fidget with the fashion-plate.</p>

<p>"It is for your good, Meg, that I speak," resumed
the young man. "You must wish to be like
your mother; and you cannot grow up good and
hard-working and honest if you think your mother
was rich and left you poor, with no one to look
after you or care for you."</p>

<p>"It was not her fault," said the child faintly.</p>

<p>"It would have been her fault," he answered
severely, shaking his head. "My dear Meg, put
away this foolish idea. Call up your mother to
your mind as a good, toiling woman; one of God's
ladies, as I called her before. Try to be like her.
Lay aside the thought that she was one of those
carriage ladies."</p>

<p>"I won't!" interrupted the child, standing pale
and upright, clutching the fashion-plate close up
against her chest. "It's a lie! She was a lady!"</p>

<p>A smothered exclamation rose to Mr. Standish's
lips. It was the first offensive word he had heard
the child use.</p>

<p>"Meg," he cried, following the fluttering little
figure up the stairs.</p>

<p>He saw her enter an attic; he heard the door
slam and the bolt drawn.</p>

<p>"Meg," he called again gently.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>There came no answer; but Mr. Standish thought
he heard the sound of passionate sobbing. He
waited, called a third time, and receiving no response
he shrugged his shoulders and turned away.</p>

<p>The exigencies of the press absorbed Mr. Standish
so completely that for the next few days he had no
time to think of Meg. He noticed that the corner
on the top lobby was empty, and a vague feeling
of regret crossed his mind.</p>

<p>On the third day he was disturbed by a great
clatter in the kitchen and the noise of many voices,
above which that of Meg rose shrill and angry.
Jessie, the hard-worked slavey of the establishment,
admitted when she came up with the coal-scuttle,
in answer to Mr. Standish's inquiries concerning
the cause of the trouble, that it was Meg's fault.
She was not like the same child. She was like
beside herself&mdash;she was&mdash;these last three days.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish was perplexed, and resolved, after
completing the weekly budget he was writing for
the <i>Melbourne Banner</i>, to seek out the child, and
get the clew to this sudden demoralization.</p>

<p>He was confirmed in this resolution when, in returning
from the post, he came upon Meg in fierce
encounter with some boys. She was fighting
valiantly, but numbers proved too much. Mr.
Standish stepped up to the rescue. He caught one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
boy by the ear, rolled another in the dust, and
generally dispersed the assailants on all sides. Meg
waited, watching, on the outskirts of the fray; but
as soon as Mr. Standish had disposed of her enemies
she turned and fled, disheveled, homeward. The
account her rescuer received left little doubt on his
mind that Meg had been the aggressive party.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish sought Mrs. Browne. The landlady
was lachrymose and muddled. To his inquiries
concerning the queer notion Meg had concerning
her mother, she gave a rambling account of a
mysterious lady who had come to the lodgings
accompanied by an older lady. Meg had been born
here, and the mother had died in giving her birth.
No father had ever come to visit the mother or
child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Browne admitted that some money was
sent regular through a lawyer&mdash;just enough to
pay for Meg's clothing and schooling; but who the
lawyer was, Mrs. Browne refused to tell.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish left Mrs. Browne drying her eyes,
and went up, meditating how to address Meg.
There had come to him an indistinct realization of
what the thought of a lady-mother had been to the
child in her sordid surroundings. After a few
moments' deliberation he took out pen, ink, and
paper, and wrote in Roman characters:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Meg</span>: I write to ask you to forgive me.
You were right, and I was wrong. Your mother was
a lady, just as you thought she was. I have heard
all about her. Won't you forgive me, and come
and see me? I feel lonely without my little friend.</p>

<p class="right">
"W. S."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Having folded the letter, he slipped it under the
child's door; then he returned to his room and
waited, leaving his own door ajar. After awhile
he began to sing some of Meg's favorite melodies&mdash;"Sally
in the Alley" and "Margery Allen." He
thought he heard a furtive step. He turned his
head away, so as not to frighten by so much as a
glance the shy advance, and began softly to sing
Meg's favorite ballad:</p>

<p>
<span class="i2">"Nellie was a lady&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">Last night she died."</span>
</p>

<p>He fancied he distinguished the reluctant drawing
near of tardy feet. When the song was ended he
looked round. Meg was on the threshold. A
glance revealed the change those four days had
wrought. Her hair was unkempt, her dress untidy,
her cheeks pale; but it was not so much those
signs of neglect, the pallor of her cheeks, the drawn
lines about her mouth that startled him, as a certain
expression of childish recklessness. It was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Meg he had seen wrangling with boys in the street,
flying past him lawless and fierce. In her hand
she held his letter, and she kept her eyes fixed
upon him with a bold stare.</p>

<p>"Is it true what you have written here, or is it
a pack of stories?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"It is all true, Meg," said Mr. Standish gently.
"She was a lady."</p>

<p>"A real lady, like those that drive about in the
carriages?" asked the child with stern cross-examination.</p>

<p>"She was a real lady, Meg; just as you have
always pictured her&mdash;with soft hands that had
never done rough work, and a gentle voice. All
about her was beautiful," replied Mr. Standish in
slow and convinced tones.</p>

<p>At this assurance Meg gave a little sigh; the
tension about her lips relaxed; the fierce brilliancy
of her interrogative glance was subdued.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" she asked more softly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Browne told me. I will take you to her,
and she will tell it to you."</p>

<p>"I don't want her to tell me, you tell me," said
Meg quickly.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish hesitated; under the child's innocent
gaze he found it difficult to speak. He told
her in simple words some of the story Mrs. Browne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
had related. It was a mercy Meg evinced no
curiosity concerning her father. Mr. Standish
dwelt upon the beauty, the youth, the suffering of
the mother; he spoke of the love she had lavished
in anticipation upon the babe she was never to
see.</p>

<p>As he spoke, the thought of that early and lonely
death thrust itself before him with a new and
piteous force. The thought of the forsaken child
moved him, and his voice faltered.</p>

<p>Meg was by his side in a moment; her hand
touched his. "You asked me in your letter to forgive
you," she whispered. "I forgive you."</p>

<p>He took the little hand. "You must forget also,
Meg, that I said your mother had left you poor
and uncared for."</p>

<p>"But she did. She left me poor, and with
strangers; that's what you said," replied Meg, with
a return of the old fierceness, quoting his words.</p>

<p>"She died," he answered with emphasis, bending
forward. "Listen, Meg," he continued, as the child
remained apparently unsoftened, "will you believe
me, even if you do not understand me&mdash;will you
believe me?"</p>

<p>For a moment Meg remained dogged and silent,
then, as she met his troubled glance, the doubt
passed from hers, the confiding light came back.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe you; I believe you very much," she
said.</p>

<p>"Then, when you think of her, Meg, think that
some one had done her great injury&mdash;had made her
suffer, more than you can know. That is why she
came here and died. She left you poor because
everything had been taken from her."</p>

<p>He paused a moment. Meg was pale, and seemed
a little dazed; but the excitement had left her
manner.</p>

<p>"Everything," he repeated with emphasis.</p>

<p>The child's bosom heaved.</p>

<p>"Now that she is dead," resumed the young man,
"I believe that dear mother watches over her little
daughter."</p>

<p>"You believe it," said Meg slowly.</p>

<p>"I believe it," said Mr. Standish. "But, come;
where is that picture? Let me look at it again."</p>

<p>Meg was off and back again in a moment. The
print was torn and besmeared, as if it had gone
through rough usage since he had seen it last.</p>

<p>"Halloo! it is falling to bits. It was not so
crumpled and torn the other day," he remarked.</p>

<p>"No," Meg confessed; "I hated it the other
night, when you said mother was hard-working,
like a charwoman. I wanted to tear it up&mdash;I did;
but I could not." She stopped; for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
there came a choking in her throat, and a sob,
quickly repressed.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish pretended absorption in his occupation,
spread out the tattered print, and announced
his intention of bestowing to the painting a new
lease of life by pasting it upon a pasteboard back.
He gathered the necessary implements for the task.
Meg, usually so active, watched in silence; but he
knew, by the trembling of the little hand resting
on the table, by the stiff uprightness of the small
figure beside him, the fierce battle the child was
waging with herself to suppress all show of emotion.</p>

<p>He took no apparent heed of her, but proceeded
with the task of renovation. Perhaps he had intended
still to lead the child's mind to a truer conception
of a lady than she could get from worship
of this simpering fetish, with a mouth like a cherry,
and curled eyelashes; but as he handled the old
fashion-plate, the pathos of its smeared and battered
condition touched him with a sense of sacredness,
and he found himself declaring that her mother
might have been like that picture. There was no
doubt about it; it represented a lovely creature,
and her mother was a lovely lady.</p>

<p>When the task was completed he was rewarded
by the sight of Meg's radiant countenance. In
perfect peace she carried off the restored picture.</p>
<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>TWO YEARS LATER.</h3>


<p>Two years had elapsed, and to superficial observers
Meg might have appeared to have changed
only by some inches added to her length of limb.
She still haunted the corner overlooking the stairs
on the topmost lobby, but it was not to watch the
come and go of the shabby social eddies breaking
down below. She read much to herself. Her
choice of literature was a queer <i>mélange</i> of odds
and ends. She was up to all the fires, the accidents,
the pageants of a world into which she had never
set foot. She knew to what corner of a London
daily paper and provincial weekly she was to look
to find descriptions of these sensational incidents,
and the style in which they were recorded stirred
in her an admiration worthy of being lavished on
Homeric epics. She knew also a number of ballads
by heart that she would recite with an amount of
native dramatic vividness.</p>

<p>If the shifting scenes going on downstairs no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
longer attracted her as in the past, she was intent
and absorbed in watching one life. The friendship
between her and Mr. Standish had become a tie
that drew out peculiarities of the child's nature.
There had been quarrels, coolnesses, reconciliations,
but Meg's usual attitude toward the journalist was
one of mingled proprietorship and watchfulness.
It was a mixture of motherly solicitude and dog-like
faithfulness. She cross-questioned, admonished,
and kept vigilant guard over his interests.</p>

<p>Once, having discovered that Mrs. Browne had
cheated him of sixpence in the weekly bill, she
drew the landlady's notice to the overcharge; but
Mrs. Browne refused to acknowledge or set it right,
and Meg cried herself to sleep. Loyalty to the
landlady was discarded, and with brimming eyes
and quivering lips she told Mr. Standish next day
of that fraudulent sixpence. To her dismay he
laughed, and vowed that Mrs. Browne's name
ought to be handed down to posterity as an honest
landlady if sixpence covered the amount of a week's
cheating. Meg would not be comforted; to her the
landlady seemed remorseless.</p>

<p>A mother could not have detected with quicker
apprehension a shade of weariness or pallor on the
young man's face. Her invariable question on
such an occasion would be, "What have you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
for dinner?" Sometimes he tried to deceive her.
He would roll out a dazzling <i>menu</i>&mdash;turtle soup,
turbot, plum-pudding.</p>

<p>She would stop him at once with pathetic and
angry remonstrance. "It is not true; you know it
is not true. Why do you say it?"</p>

<p>Her earnestness always moved him; he was
ashamed of deceiving her.</p>

<p>Their last quarrel had been caused by Mr.
Standish's confession that he had dined off fish.</p>

<p>"Fish!" cried Meg with scorn, tossing her head.
"Can you work after a bit of fish? What fish&mdash;turbot,
salmon, fried soles?" The ladies who occupied
the drawing-room floor gave occasional dinner-parties,
where such delicacies figured.</p>

<p>As Mr. Standish kept shaking his head, the smile
in his eyes growing more amused and tender, a
terrible idea dawned upon Meg. She grew pale.</p>

<p>"Herring!" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Herrings," he repeated in a voice of rich appreciation.
"Two herrings, fat as lord mayors!"</p>

<p>Meg walked about the room, her eyes bright with
angry misery, her lips trembling. "It's downright
wicked! You want to kill yourself, that's what you
want to do." She flicked a tear away. "A workman
in the street down there has a better dinner
than that."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Meg, be reasonable," the young man
pleaded in a voice of protest. "Don't you see," he
went on, striking his left palm with two fingers of
the right hand, "there is a day called 'pay-day'
that rules my bill of fare, as I explained to you the
other day the moon rules the tides. On pay-day
and its immediate followers I live in abundance.
Then come days of lesser luxuries, then abstinence.
I have reached this period. Soon plenty will reign
again."</p>

<p>"It is a foolish way of managing money," said
Meg, abrupt in her trouble, and only half-comforted.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me, Meg, how to manage money
without reference to pay-day?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Will you do as I tell you?" she said, stopping
short in her restless peregrinations.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Take your money, all your money, and divide
it into little parcels, as many parcels as there are
days it must last, and every day spend just what
is inside one of the little parcels, and not a bit
more," said Meg with elucidating gestures.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish vowed she spoke like a chancellor
of the exchequer; that the more he heard her the
more he was determined on coming into the colossal
fortune he was to enjoy some day, to appoint her
his almoner, housekeeper, the dispenser of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
bounties, the orderer of his dinners. This project
to be his housekeeper was one dear to Meg's heart,
the pacifier of her wrath. By what means Mr.
Standish was to come into possession of this fabulous
wealth remained vague. Sometimes he would announce
his intention of getting it by marrying
an heiress, a project always chillingly received by
Meg. Sometimes she would suggest spitefully that
the heiress would not marry him; but Mr. Standish
overrode all objections, and would depict days of
indolent delight for himself and his bride, while
Meg managed the household. When the daydream
reached this point it generally abruptly terminated
by Meg plunging out of the room, and banging the
door after her with an emphatic "Shan't!"</p>

<p>On the evening of the fish dinner Mr. Standish
left the heiress out of the question, and Meg was
softened.</p>

<p>The next day the young man supped at home.
His tray, as usual on these occasions, was brought
in by Meg. A burly German sausage and a pot of
Scotch marmalade graced the board. Meg's answers
were evasive concerning the source from
which these dainties came. It struck Mr. Standish
that Meg had bought them with the store of half-pence
he had taught her to put away in a moneybox
he had himself presented to her, with a view to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
inculcating economical instincts. Her fierce refusal
to answer convinced him that he had guessed right.</p>

<p>The refusal to touch these dainties died on his
lips. He could not hurt the child. He ate the
supper she had provided with loud laudations of its
excellence. Before it was finished an arrangement
had been entered into between them. On pay-day
Meg would henceforth receive a sum to be kept for
him against the days of privation. The contract
had been fulfilled. Meg had proved a stern
treasurer, resisting the young man's entreaties to
dole out portions of the money before the appointed
time.</p>

<p>If the child had gained much by intercourse with
an educated mind, if her English had grown by it
more refined and correct, her mind stored with more
definite and varied knowledge; if, above all, there
had come to her by this affection a precocious
womanliness, taming and sweetening her lonely
life, Mr. Standish had gained as much by the tie
between them. A sort of wonder, half-amused,
half-tender, sometimes awoke in his heart at the
thought of the child's devotion. His occupation
led him to see rough sides of life, and as he became
familiar with degradation, the goodness, the
innocence of the child was ever before him. He
felt it was touching to be loved by a child of ten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Her advanced wisdom struck him. If it stirred
his sense of humor and inclined him to laugh, still
it made him thoughtful.</p>

<p>During those two years he had enlarged his connections.
He was earning more money. Individuals,
somewhat of unkempt appearance, whom Meg disapproved
of thoroughly, often made their way up
the stairs to the young man's rooms. The peals of
laughter, the loud talk emerging from the sanctum,
confirmed Meg in judging these visitors foolish
company for her hero. The child grew hot with
angry apprehension when the bell rang shortly
after their coming, and Jessie would answer it with
tumblers of whisky and lemons. On letting out
these friends Meg thought that Mr. Standish
usually looked excited, his eyes brighter, his manner
more expansive. The child grew restless, alert,
suspicious. She did not disguise her feelings to Mr.
Standish. Why did these rough men come drinking
his whisky? She would break into fierce
denunciations against drink.</p>

<p>"Madam"&mdash;Mrs. Browne&mdash;"always said she was
poor. Why was she poor? Because she was always
a-sipping and drinking. He'd keep being
poor too."</p>

<p>Often Meg's tones, staccato with prophetic denunciation,
would falter at the picture she evoked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Standish listened sometimes with an amused
and indulgent good humor that exasperated Meg;
sometimes an uneasy qualm was perceptible in his
voice as he admitted that Meg was wise; sometimes
he assumed a superior tone of disapproval
that silenced her for the time, but left her more
than ever under the shadow of a vague and sorrowful
apprehension.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon Mr. Standish emerged
from his room ready to sally forth. Meg appeared
out of her shadowy corner.</p>

<p>"Going out?" she asked shortly.</p>

<p>He nodded, smiling down with benign amusement.
He seemed enveloped in a holiday brightness.</p>

<p>"Going with those horrid men?" she resumed,
throwing her words out with sorrowful brevity.</p>

<p>He nodded, and drew out his watch. He was
apparently in a mood to be entertained.</p>

<p>"Come, Meg, there are five minutes for a sermon.
I will listen to it respectfully, as if it were
the Archbishop of Canterbury preaching."</p>

<p>But Meg was too much absorbed to mind a joke.
She followed him into his sitting-room, and began
restlessly walking about.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish sat down, and as he stroked his hat
with his sleeve he watched the little figure's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
perambulations. Meg wore her Sunday gown, a
rusty black velveteen, foldless and clinging, buttoned
from throat to hem. She had outgrown its
scanty proportions. Her feet, incased in black
felt slippers, looked large under the trim ankles.</p>

<p>"Well, Meg, I am waiting," said Mr. Standish.</p>

<p>"Don't go," said the child, stopping short and
facing him abruptly. The quaint austerity of the
skimpy garment brought out the lines of the childish
figure as she stood erect and animated before him.</p>

<p>"Why not, Meg?"</p>

<p>"Because they're bad; because I hate them; because
they'll bring you to misery," said the child,
with an upward flash of one little brown well-formed
hand, and with a piteous emphasis on the
last word.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Meg!" said Mr. Standish, impatient
because more impressed than he cared to be. "You
keep comparing my friends with Mrs. Browne&mdash;I
don't mean any disrespect&mdash;an uneducated
tippling old woman. My friends, my dear Meg,
are gentlemen, educated men, who, I admit, are
fond of a joke, fond of a glass or two glasses of
grog, but who respect themselves."</p>

<p>"Education has nothing to do with it," snapped
Meg, with concise energy. "There was a man
downstairs, he was educated. I think he was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
devil. He'd leave his wife and little child for days,
and come back drunk." Meg gave a fierce little
shudder. "There'd be scenes. One day he went
and never came back&mdash;never, and the wife and baby
boy went off one snowy day to the workhouse."</p>

<p>"Poor child, you should not see those things!"
said Mr. Standish with a troubled look.</p>

<p>"Why not? You would not let these men up
there take your money if you saw them."</p>

<p>There was a grotesque sweetness in Meg's appearance
as she stood there in her skimpy dress, her
short dusky hair falling in masses about her neck
and over her forehead. There came to the young
journalist a remembrance of those wingless angels
that the pre-Raphaelite masters painted, gracious,
grave, workaday beings, with unearthly wise faces.
But it was not as a picture that he contemplated
Meg; the thought of the goodness, the purity, the
holiness of the child, who knew so much and understood
so little of life, overcame him. Her innocence
almost frightened him. He felt the sacredness of a
vow taken to her; it would be more binding than
one taken before a court of justice.</p>

<p>"What is it that you want me to promise, Meg?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Not to let them take your money from you, not
to let them give you drink," she replied with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
accustomed unhesitancy, but her voice faltering
with harbored longing.</p>

<p>"Not drink at all?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I wish not at all; I wish not at all," she replied
with unconscious repetition.</p>

<p>"Look here, Meg; I'll promise you this&mdash;I'll not
waste my money, and I'll not tipple like Mrs.
Browne downstairs. Will that satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"You promise!" said Meg vehemently, with
another upward flash of the well-formed little
brown hand, and holding him with her eyes.</p>

<p>"I promise," said Mr. Standish gravely, disguising
an inclination to laugh.</p>

<p>The young man was busy in the intervals of
journalistic work composing a political squib. He
had not so much time to devote to Meg as in the
less-employed days, but he allowed her to sit near
him when he wrote, reading the story-books and
ballads he gave her. In his leisure, as he smoked
his pipe, he watched with half-closed eyes the
quaint little figure, and drew the child out to talk.
He explained the difficult passages in the books
she read, and gave her lessons in recitation. Better
than anything to Meg, he sometimes imparted to
her the last <i>bon mot</i> he had put into the mouth of
"Sultan Will" to his suffering subjects&mdash;a con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>fidence
that invariably produced abnormal gravity
in Meg.</p>

<p>The child had no reason to think the young man
was not fulfilling the promise he had given. His
alert carriage and concentrated expression contradicted
any suspicion of faltering. Yet she was
restless; his friends came often to see him.</p>

<p>"Why did they come, disturbing him at his
work?" she asked spitefully.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish called her a hard little taskmaster,
and received his friends cordially. A formless fear
was at the child's heart. She haunted the threshold
of his door when they were in his room; she lay
awake of nights when she knew that he had gone
out with them. She magnified to herself the number
of times that he had gone out earlier and come
home later than he used. If she dropped asleep her
slumbers were broken until she heard the sound of
his footsteps on the stairs.</p>

<p>One evening Mr. Standish went off in company
with two journalistic comrades to a public dinner,
given to members of the press by the directors of a
new railway company. Meg would not retract the
unfavorable verdict she pronounced upon his appearance
in the new dress suit he had ordered
specially for the occasion. She was not to be
mollified by the promise of an orange from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
directors' table. "She did not want an orange;
she did not see what a dinner had to do with a
railway," she averred.</p>

<p>That night she could not sleep. The formless
fear at her heart lay heavy upon it; it seemed to
her that the fulfillment of that nameless dread was
approaching. As the hour came and passed Mr.
Standish had fixed for his return, visions began to
group about her bed and pass before her wide-open
eyes. All the sorrowful stories of accidents Mr.
Standish had related to her enacted themselves
before her, in which he appeared the central figure.
The night plodded slowly on; the clock in the hall
struck the hours at intervals. When the clock
struck three Meg got up and paced about the room,
a wan little ghost.</p>

<p>When another hour struck the four peals sounded
like a hammer-stroke on a coffin. Meg began to
dress. She did not know why she did so, or what
she would do after, but a vague sense of being
needed impelled her. She fumbled her way to the
staircase and sat on the topmost step.</p>

<p>She waited in the darkness and silence. A faint
whiteness began to steal through the sides of the
blinds drawn over the window on the lobby. The
banisters, the flight of stairs, showed shadowily,
gradually growing more distinct.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly she sprang to her feet. There was the
scrape of a key in the latch. A step sounded in the
hall, made its way up the stairs. It was Mr.
Standish. When he reached the topmost flight of
steps he perceived the little gray figure standing
waiting in the gray dawn, erect, immobile. He
steadied himself against the banisters and began to
laugh. He looked pale, his eyes dark; his hat was
thrown back, his hair disordered.</p>

<p>"Why, Meg, you little detective, are you there?
Such a jolly night! splendid dinner! No humbug
this time, Meg&mdash;real turtle, tuns of champagne!" He
came up a few steps. "Tuns of champagne, Meg!
Speeches, Meg! Such nonsense! Everybody complimented
everybody else. I did not forget you,
Meg. Look here, I stole an orange and sweetmeats!"
He began fumbling in his pockets.</p>

<p>"You've broken your promise," said the child in
a low and trembling voice.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, Meg. Now you think I am
tipsy," he replied, speaking huskily. "Not a bit of
it. You'll see if I can't walk straight as a lamp post
to that door."</p>

<p>As he went up he staggered&mdash;she had not seen
him stumble before&mdash;caught himself by the balustrade,
then plunged forward with uneven steps.</p>

<p>Instinctively Meg put out her hand, but he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
not see it. Catching at the wall he fell into a fit
of laughing; then making his way to his room he
let the door slam behind him.</p>

<p>Meg was petrified. All that she had dreaded
seemed to have happened. She sat down, her throat
burning, her body cold, as if a shroud enfolded her.
She remained huddled and moveless until signs of
life began to be heard in the house. Then she got
up and crept into her attic.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>MEG TO THE RESCUE.</h3>


<p>Mr. Standish saw no more of Meg for some days.
He made no attempt at reconciliation. It amused
him to think how Meg magnified his offense. It
seemed comical that the child should set him down
as a drunkard. He laughed out loud over it as he
drank his single glass of lager beer at dinner. In
his workaday life he avoided taking his glass of
grog. He never indulged in it, for economical
reasons. With his brothers of the press he took a
convivial glass, but as for squandering money, he
had none to spend.</p>

<p>After a few days, as Meg remained sternly invisible,
he began to miss her, as a man might miss
a favorite dog. To his inquiries concerning the
child, Mrs. Browne or Jessie replied, she was "that"
cross there was no biding her.</p>

<p>If he caught a glimpse of Meg she would vanish
at his approach, and no call or song could entice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
her from her retreat. Then Mr. Standish made up
his mind the child was absurdly unjust, and that in
time she would come round; still he was more
sorry than he allowed himself to acknowledge at
her desertion. His work had grown upon him, an
old debt harassed him, and he had lately received
a sufficiently unpleasant surprise to occupy his mind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the passionate little figure, hidden in
the shadow of the half-open door, watched his
coming and going with keener vigilance. From
her hiding-place the child scanned his countenance
as he came and went; and at night fell into broken
slumbers, until the sound of his returning footsteps
brought peace to her unquiet heart. If Meg had
known how to pray, or had realized that she could
effectively and without indecorum pray out of
church, she would have climbed in spirit to the
throne of the Most High, and with insistent appeal
have interceded for the friend she confusedly felt
was passing through some dread peril. But Meg's
conception of the world beyond the grave was as of
a great darkness, against which outlined itself a
simpering countenance wreathed with roses, which
was her mother's face. To that dear vision Meg
was eloquent concerning her grief&mdash;brokenly, and
with impatient and angry misery, murmured to it
of Mr. Standish's breach of faith, of the certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
ruin that was waiting him, and of her own wretchedness.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish's ways completely puzzled her, and
the mystery added to that desperate sense of
estrangement between them. Some time before
their quarrel she had watched one day a shabby-genteel-looking
man knock at the journalist's door,
and, on its being opened, hand to Mr. Standish a
paper which he received and glanced over, the child
noticed, with an expression of surprised consternation.
He did not invite the visitor in. Meg could
not distinguish the purport of the talk that ensued
between them, but heard Mr. Standish's last words,
in the anxiously confident tones of which, she detected
a ghost of displeasure: "There has been
some delay, but give me time to write again to him
and I am sure it will be all right."</p>

<p>On her inquiries concerning this mysterious
visitor, with a face she described as a red plum-pudding,
Mr. Standish had given evasive answers.
From that day she noted, however, that he changed
his hours of going out; he appeared anxious; he
locked his door after him. Sometimes, as a pledge
of confidence, he had left his key with her, and he
had told her not to let anyone in during his absence.</p>

<p>A week after their falling out, Meg, in looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
over the superscription of Mr. Standish's letter in
the hall, recognized the delicate and familiar handwriting
of one of the young man's friends&mdash;who
was also her favorite antipathy. She had at one
time often brought epistles in this handwriting
that she suspected were begging petitions. This
letter bore a foreign stamp.</p>

<p>That afternoon Mr. Standish's voice, for the first
time since his quarrel, was uplifted in song. As he
went out he paused, and softly called "Meg." But
Meg, in the shadow, straightened herself; an aggressive
light brightened her eyes; she hesitated. Had
he called again she might have come, but with a
half-vexed laugh and a shrug he ran downstairs.</p>

<p>For the first time, also, he had left the key in his
door. The child stole toward the room, opened the
door, and looked in. Her heart smote her with
remorse and pity as she beheld the disorder, the
uncared-for confusion that reigned within&mdash;slippers
pitched at different corners of the room; the
tobacco-pouch half emptying its contents in a
manuscript, the dust lying heavy on papers and
books, the boot-jack inside the silver inkstand that
had belonged to his father.</p>

<p>In a moment Meg was at her old task of setting
the room in order. Flitting hither and thither, she
zealously dusted, swept, put the books back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
their accustomed places. She knew exactly where
every volume was to stand. As she scrubbed and
worked, the hard knot at her little heart loosened.
She had proceeded some way at her task when she
came upon a paper. She recognized the nature of
the paper at a glance; she had seen such a missive
in Mrs. Browne's possession before. It was a summons
to appear before the county court. She read
the words on the paper. The summons was taken
out by one Abraham Samuels, who held a bill overdue
for £25. The court was to sit on Wednesday,
November 16th. To-day was the 26th&mdash;ten days
later.</p>

<p>Meg stood stock-still with the paper in her hand.
This was the paper the strange man had brought.
She thought of Mr. Standish's brightened mood;
what did it mean? Had he paid the debt? A tear
dropped on the summons as she dwelt upon that
past anxiety. How could she atone for having kept
away so sternly? The only way that presented
itself to her mind for displaying the energy of her
repentance was by rubbing the furniture till it
shone in the firelight. She put the last touch to
her work by filling the two vases with late autumn
foliage and yellow chrysanthemums, bought with
her remaining pence. It was late that night when
the journalist returned, but she noticed that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
bounded lightly up the stairs, and she turned happily
on her side and fell asleep. Mr. Standish
was not up next morning when Meg set off for
school.</p>

<p>He was out when she returned. As she was
sallying forth on an errand for Mrs. Browne she
perceived Jessie in deep confabulation with a smooth-voiced
stranger in the hall, who was apparently
making himself agreeable to the slavey. At a
glance she recognized him to be the stranger with
the face like a red plum-pudding, who had handed
that summons to Mr. Standish.</p>

<p>In a flash she recollected the key was in the door
of the journalist's room. The next moment her
bounding young feet had carried her up the stairs,
and she had locked the door, and dropped the key
into her apron pocket, before the representative of
justice came panting up on the scene. Meg's experience
of life had included strange branches of
education. She had watched the maneuvers of
debtors to keep bailiffs at bay, and the strategy of
the men in authority to get into possession.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she inquired, standing
before the threshold she was defending.</p>

<p>"I want Mr. Standish&mdash;a writing gent. I've got
news for him," replied the stranger with an air of
business.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't see him," said Meg briefly. "He's out,
and the door's locked."</p>

<p>"Now, that's awful unfortunate," replied the
visitor, with an air of perplexed consternation.
"Those writing gents make their living by getting
news, and my news is so important that he ought
to know it."</p>

<p>"What news is it? I'll tell him when he comes
in," said Meg curtly.</p>

<p>"Can't do that, missy. Now, I take it," continued
the stranger insinuatingly, "you know where
the key of that room is. If you let me in, I'll give
you the prettiest, shiniest sixpence you ever saw.
Come, now, let me in, and I'll write my news
down for the gent. My time's precious-like, you
see."</p>

<p>"Who are you? Where do you come from?"
asked Meg.</p>

<p>"I come from his newspaper office. I am what
these writing gents call a printer's devil, ha, ha,
ha!"&mdash;and the stranger bubbled over with enjoyment
of his own joke.</p>

<p>"You're telling an awful fib," said Meg, red to
the roots of her hair. "You are a bailiff. I've seen
bailiffs," and she nodded, "and I know their dodges.
You want to get into Mr. Standish's room to take
his things&mdash;that's what you want to do."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eh, now, you are clever&mdash;as clever as clever
can be&mdash;the prettiest, cleverest little girl!" rejoined
the visitor admiringly.</p>

<p>"Do you think," said Meg, evidently taking no
notice of the compliment, "that a man ought to be
punished who is always very kind and good, and
who works&mdash;works so hard&mdash;I could not tell you
how hard; who eats very little, and who scarcely
drinks ever at all&mdash;that is, very seldom." Meg
dashed away a tear, and went on with energy,
advancing with restless steps. "If this good man
has friends who are bad, dishonest, lazy drunkards,
who take all his money and don't give it back, don't
you think it is they who ought to be punished, not
the good man?"</p>

<p>"Well, missy, there's a deal in what you say&mdash;a
deal," said the stranger ponderingly; then, as Meg
approached, lost in her pleading, he made a sudden
flop forward, and almost clutched her skirt, gasping,
"That's a pretty apron, missy&mdash;a nice little
apron."</p>

<p>But Meg had whisked the apron out of his grasp;
and, dancing back, shook the hair out of her eyes.
"You wickedest man! trying to get the key out of
my pocket! But I'll not let you have it. I'll throw
it out of that window into the gutter that runs
down there sooner than let you have it." Meg as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
she spoke opened the window in the lobby, and kept
near it.</p>

<p>"Then here I'll sit!" said the bailiff, depositing
his burly form on the stair.</p>

<p>"How long will you sit there?" asked Meg.</p>

<p>"That's none of your business. I'll sit till he
comes up. I believe he's a scamp. Those hauthors
and hartists are. I know lots of 'em. I warrant
he's in the tavern spending his money."</p>

<p>"I hate you!" cried Meg with a flash, her bosom
heaving, her little red lips drawn tight over her
teeth.</p>

<p>There was something pitiably droll in the attitude
of the child, standing at a safe distance,
clutching her pocket, quivering with helpless wrath,
before the impassable persecutor. With a sudden
spring she turned and dashed away, pausing to open
a little wider the window that let in the draft
upon the bailiff.</p>

<p>"You'll get frightful rheumatism waiting there,
and I'm glad of it," she cried, as she disappeared.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish, returning half an hour later, saw a
small figure promenading up and down before the
house under a dripping umbrella. It was Meg.
She was by his side in a moment.</p>

<p>"Come this minute," she said, putting her hand
into his.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Meg," he said cheerily, yet surprised
at her manner; "so you have forgiven me at
last!"</p>

<p>She did not answer; but as he was about to open
the hall door with his latchkey, she said laconically,
"Not this way," and led him round by the back
way.</p>

<p>Meg flitted up the narrow stairs before him, every
now and then turning back with forefinger on lips
to enjoin silence. Up, up she went, until she
reached the attic that was her own room. She
signed to him to enter, and then shut the door.</p>

<p>"Why, what is this for, Meg," said Mr. Standish,
looking round.</p>

<p>"He's here&mdash;the bailiff&mdash;waiting on the stairs,
but he can't get in. I locked the door and kept the
key; here it is." With an expressive twinkle of
her eyes she whisked it out of her pocket, and put
it into his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish sat down, looked at Meg, scarce
understanding. "Bailiff!" he repeated. "Then
Gilbert has not paid! I backed his bill because I
trusted his sacred promise that he would meet it in
time!"</p>

<p>"It was kind, but foolish," said Meg briefly.</p>

<p>"He wrote the other day to say he would make
it all right with Samuels, when I told him of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
writ. He assured me the money was going by the
next post," Mr. Standish went on blankly.</p>

<p>"He's an old cheat," said Meg, with scornful
directness of speech.</p>

<p>"What is to be done? I have no money, Meg,"
said the young man, with a wretched flicker of a
smile.</p>

<p>"Pawn your watch and chain&mdash;they're real gold;
they're big and heavy; they'll raise the money,"
said Meg, with her usual unhesitancy.</p>

<p>The journalist flushed red. "I can't, Meg!" He
drew the watch out of his pocket. It was a large
hunting watch, that had been presented to the
rector, his father. Inside the lid the names of the
donors were inscribed in minute characters. "I
can't, Meg," he repeated, looking at it and shaking
his head. "A token of affectionate gratitude, a
testimonial to his faithful work&mdash;I can't place it
where there are so many associations that are disgraceful.
It would be degradation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!" said Meg with fearless rapidity,
as he rose and walked up and down the attic.
"You'll get it back soon. You'll work hard to get
it out. If you don't pawn it you'll have to let that
man in," nodding in the direction of the staircase.
"He'll sit in your room. You'll be able to do no
work with him there, smelling of gin, and his red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
face looking at you. He'll take the silver ink-bottle&mdash;and
the books. Pawn your watch, and if
you work hard you'll get it out soon."</p>

<p>"Wise, practical Meg," said Mr. Standish, scarcely
able to repress a smile, moving irresolutely about
the little room.</p>

<p>"Give it to me! I'll pawn it for you," rejoined
Meg, intent and business-like. "I've been there
before. Last time Mrs. Browne put the silver
teapot up the spout I went for her. She was tipsy;
she could not go. The man knows me. He'll give
me the money."</p>

<p>"I have not the heart to do it Meg&mdash;I have not
the heart," said Mr. Standish, hesitating as the
child approached.</p>

<p>"It's better than having the man inside your
room, sitting on your green velvet armchair or the
chintz sofa, taking the silver ink-bottle and the
books, and preventing your working," continued
Meg, pressing her advantage; and as Mr. Standish
began slowly to unloose the chain, her deft fingers
came to the rescue and helped him.</p>

<p>He looked down at the eager, determined child-face.
"How good you are to me, Meg; how good!"
he said, the words rushing almost unconsciously to
his lips.</p>

<p>A quiver of the eyelids only showed the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
felt the tones. "Give it to me," she repeated imperatively.</p>

<p>The next moment the watch and chain, wrapped
in a clean pocket-handkerchief, were in Meg's grasp,
and she had departed. Mr. Standish, stooping under
the shelving ceiling on a level with the strip of
window, looked out and watched the wet umbrella
making its way under the flaring gas and over the
muddy street. When it disappeared he turned and
looked about him. There was a sincerity, a poverty,
a purity about the tiny chamber that affected him
with a wholesome shock. Over the little white
bed hung the fashion-plate that he had mended, in
the pasteboard frame he had manufactured for it.
A bit of scarlet ribbon fastened it to a nail, with
an elaborate bow. Above it, as a pious Catholic
might have crossed about some saint's image
branches of blessed palms, so Meg had placed
sprigs of lavender, that delicately scented the
room. On the peg behind the door hung the little
Sunday frock, turned inside out. On a table, under
a clean pocket-handkerchief, were placed three
books that he had given her&mdash;a volume of ballads,
"Stories from the History of England," a gaudily
illustrated shilling copy of "Cinderella." Also under
the pocket-handkerchief was a bundle of paper,
tied with scarlet ribbon, that proved to be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of his articles neatly cut out. A black clay pipe
of his, which Meg had mended, was put up like a
little Indian idol over the table. The little room,
so spotlessly clean, and so characteristic in all its
details, was distinctly Meg's room, telling of that
mystic love for her mother, and of her solitary
friendship.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish was not tired of waiting when Meg
appeared, her hand clutching the bodice of her dress.</p>

<p>"Here, I've got the money," she said, as carefully
pulling out the handkerchief and opening it she
displayed a roll covered with paper; "twenty-five
pounds&mdash;count; and here's the ticket. Don't lose
it on any account. Perhaps I'd better keep it
for you."</p>

<p>"Twenty-five pounds, Meg!" said Mr. Standish.</p>

<p>"He wanted to give me twenty. I said 'No,
twenty-five.' He was smiling when he said twenty.
Those men always smile when they want to cheat
you," said Meg, with a nod of retrospective observation.
"He gave me twenty-five pounds at last,
though. Count."</p>

<p>The child cut short the words of thankfulness
that rose to Mr. Standish's lips.</p>

<p>"Go," she said imperatively, taking him by the
hand and leading him to the door; "pay the man
and get him off."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes later, with great glee, Meg watched
the departure of the bailiff; she thought with
pleasure as he made his way downstairs that he
seemed a little stiff, as if he had got rheumatism.
After the hall door had slammed behind the representative
of the law she stood hesitating. Soon
her diffident feet slowly brought her to Mr.
Standish's threshold. She pushed the door softly
open. He was sitting by the table, his face covered
with his hands. He looked up as she entered.</p>

<p>"He's gone," said Meg, nodding. "Aren't you
glad?"</p>

<p>"You have done me a great service, Meg. How
can I thank you for it?" said the young man, rising
and taking the child's two hands in his.</p>

<p>"Don't thank me&mdash;not at all," said Meg with
ardor, looking up into his face. "Just promise
never to lend your money again&mdash;never."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;never again!" replied Mr. Standish, shaking
his head. He led the child in and sat down, still
keeping her hand in his. "How did you guess that
man was a bailiff?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Meg, with the scornful brevity of
wide experience in her voice, "I knew him by his
sleeky ways. I've watched them at their dodges.
They're up to almost anything."</p>

<p>Mr. Standish laughed out loud; but the laugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
suddenly fell as he thought of all that knowledge
implied. He said gently, after a pause:</p>

<p>"I thought the little friend who used to sit by my
fireside had left me. I missed you, Meg."</p>

<p>"You were tipsy that night," the child answered,
with a quaver in her voice that did not take from
its severity.</p>

<p>"You punished me hard, Meg. Don't you know
I had to drink so many healths. There was the
queen's health to drink, and I should have been a
disloyal subject if I had not drunk that; and there
was the lord mayor's health, I should have been a
bad citizen if I had not drunk that; then there were
the directors' healths, and there were one another's
healths." As Meg remained unmollified, he went
on, "Meg, I will tell you a secret. I was not so
bad as I looked that night&mdash;I put it on a little for
your benefit."</p>

<p>"That was wicked of you," said Meg with spirit.</p>

<p>"It was," agreed Mr. Standish candidly. "Come,
Meg, won't you forgive me if I promise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You promised before," interrupted the child.</p>

<p>A desire to rehabilitate himself in the child's eyes
seized Mr. Standish. He felt a touch of awe of that
creature regarding him with steady gravity, and he
found himself pleading his cause before her as if she
were a little chief justice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"If he got himself into difficulties for his friends,
they were often to be pitied; so many in this world
were born weak, like spiritual cripples who needed
a helping hand."</p>

<p>"No use to them when they get it," said Meg.
"They're always in a muddle."</p>

<p>Mr. Standish once more repressed an inclination
to laugh at the child's precocious wisdom. He admitted
there was truth in what she said. Once,
three years ago, just before coming here, he had
given all he had to a friend, and it had been of no
use.</p>

<p>"Did you lend him much money?" asked Meg.</p>

<p>"Yes; he was in the greatest distress. I loved
him, Meg. I would do it again if he came to me.
If he was reckless, he was so handsome and so jolly.
He came and told me all about his trouble. His
father was very stern; he would not see him or
help him. My friend wanted three hundred pounds.
It was all the money that I had."</p>

<p>"And you gave it?" she said, and stopped.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Did he never pay you back?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Never, Meg. It is a sad story. There was
some disgrace, and he died."</p>

<p>She did not speak; the fate of the stranger
seemed to affect her but little.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"You gave him all your money?" she repeated,
and again she paused; then she put out her hand
and stroked his head, with a look of tender and
ineffable admiration.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>FAREWELL.</h3>


<p>There followed a time of perfect happiness for
Meg, during which, for a few weeks, she sat by her
friend's fireside, watched him at his writing, listened
to his reading, ruled over the meals that he
took at home, and questioned him concerning those
that he took abroad.</p>

<p>On a memorable afternoon they celebrated together,
with much pomp, over a banquet of jam
puffs and lemonade at a confectioner's shop in the
Tottenham Court Road, the redemption from pawn
of his father's gold watch and chain. Meg again
played the part of <i>Deus ex machina</i> in the transaction,
and personally paid the ransom of the
precious pledge. In honor of the event, Mr. Standish
presented her with a copy of Goldsmith's "Animated
Nature," with "Meg" printed in gold letters on
the cover. The sight of her name thus honored
overcame the child. He explained to her, when she
appeared inclined to rebuke him for extravagance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
that the political squib, the jokes which used to
have a depressing effect upon her, had brought him
the unlooked-for cash.</p>

<p>Shortly after this festivity Mr. Standish's movements
once more became erratic. Meg could discover
no signs, however, of the symptoms that she
feared. He seemed mysteriously elated and full of
business, yet he wrote less. He admitted when she
questioned him that something was absorbing his
time, but his answers were evasive concerning the
nature of this new interest. He promised that she
would know what it was shortly.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Standish had a long talk with Mrs.
Browne over a bottle of sherry, after which he
went out and returned late. The landlady was
maudlinly effusive over Meg that evening, puzzled
the child with her ramblingly affectionate talk, and
filled her with vague apprehension. Mr. Standish's
answers to Meg's queries were also unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>A few days later a dandified elderly gentleman
wearing a frilled shirt visited the journalist. As he
was leaving Mr. Standish called Meg in, and introduced
her to the visitor as "the child I spoke to you
about." The elderly gentleman looked at her peeringly,
with his head on one side. He chuckled,
patted her cheek, and told her if she were a good
girl something wonderful might happen to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
The announcement, far from cheering Meg, deepened
the foreboding in her heart.</p>

<p>That evening she softly entered Mr. Standish's
room. A confused dread seized her when she saw
the floor littered with books and papers lying about
in parcels. The journalist was sitting by the fire,
abstractedly poking the embers.</p>

<p>Meg touched his elbow. "Are you not going to
write to-night?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Not to-night, Meg. I am going to talk to you
instead."</p>

<p>She remained motionless by his chair, questioning
him with her glance only.</p>

<p>Still he did not speak. After a moment or two
he said abruptly, "Meg would you like to go to
school?"</p>

<p>"I go to school every day. What do you mean?"
she asked, looking at him with quick suspicion.</p>

<p>"I mean quite another sort of school&mdash;one kept
by ladies, and where your schoolfellows would be
ladies; where you would make lots of nice friends;
and where you will sleep at night instead of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean go away from here&mdash;quite?" interrupted
Meg, growing pale to the lips.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to go away for?" she
demanded, a flash of anger in her eyes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I do not like to leave you with no one
but Mrs. Browne to look after you; and I am going
away."</p>

<p>"When?" she asked tremulously.</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>She gave an exclamation that sounded like a cry.</p>

<p>He drew her to him.</p>

<p>"Listen, Meg. It will make me very unhappy
if I think you are fretting when I am gone. I want
my little friend to be brave; she must not fret."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she faltered, mastering
her emotion.</p>

<p>"I am going to travel and write accounts of what
I see, for a newspaper that will pay me very well.
It is a great lift for me, Meg, and I want you to
have your lift also."</p>

<p>She did not speak, but kept her eyes fixed upon
his face. He then gently and guardedly told her
that he had got from Mrs. Browne the name of the
family solicitor who paid for her keep. He had
gone to see him to speak of Meg. The elderly
gentleman with the frilled shirt, who had patted
her on the head, was the solicitor in question. His
name was Mr. Fullbloom. The young man did not
tell the child that he had found out how shamefully
misapplied by the landlady was the allowance she
received, nor did he tell her that he had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in writing a vivid statement of her forlorn and
neglected condition in the boarding-house.</p>

<p>He laid as light stress as he could on the refusal
of the solicitor to give up the name of the child's
mysterious patron.</p>

<p>"Some one takes a great interest in you, Meg,"
he said in conclusion; "and Mr. Fullbloom came to
assure me from that person that you would now be
placed in a first-rate school, where you will have
plenty of comrades of your own age, teachers who
will care for you; and you will grow up to be a
little lady, like your mother in the picture."</p>

<p>Meg listened cold and silent to the end.</p>

<p>"Won't you be glad to go to school to be educated?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, stiffening herself and jerking
out her words, relapsing in her excitement into
her old pronunciation. "I will hate going. I don't
want to be edicated. What do I want to be edicated
for? And if you cared for me you would not
wish me to go away, you would not."</p>

<p>Tears stood in her eyes, but anger kept them
from falling.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to remain here when I am gone
Meg?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," she replied faintly, as if her heart failed
her at the suggestion. "Why can't I go where you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
go? Who'll light your fire for you, who'll look
after you? You want somebody to look after you."</p>

<p>"I know it, Meg, and no one would look after
me as you would."</p>

<p>"I'd not want much to eat or drink," Meg went
on, alive to the economical side of the question;
"and once you said you felt lonely without me."</p>

<p>"So I will, Meg," he answered, drawing her
nearer and keeping his arm about her. "And it is
just because I care for you that I want you to go
to school, that I want you to learn all that can be
taught you. I want your little hands to grow soft,
that now are hard with housework for me."</p>

<p>The child's face worked, but she controlled the
rising sob.</p>

<p>"Listen, Meg. It may be in five years, it may
be in six years, it may be when you are a tall, accomplished
young girl of eighteen, I shall come to
the school where you are, and&mdash;" He paused.</p>

<p>"Take me home to be your housekeeper?" said
Meg.</p>

<p>A laugh drifted to his face.</p>

<p>"Better than that. We will be friends, close
friends, such friends as never were, if you go to this
school," he said.</p>

<p>"You promise?" said the child, holding him with
her eyes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>He nodded. "I promise, Meg."</p>

<p>"Then I will go to that school," she said submissively,
putting her hand into his.</p>

<p>Until eight o'clock, when she usually said good-night,
Meg helped Mr. Standish to pack up. She
asked to be allowed to remain up a little longer,
but he refused the petition.</p>

<p>"It is not good-by, Meg; it is good-night only,"
he said cheerily, stroking her head; then stooping,
he kissed the child's forehead. "God bless you,
little Meg!"</p>

<p>Meg did not go to bed. She made no pretense
to undress. She lay on the floor of her attic all
night, letting the solitude of the coming years pass
in anticipation over her heart. In the gray of the
morning some furtive sounds reached her ears, and
she sprang up listening. A few moments after,
Mr. Standish, portmanteau in hand, emerged from
his room. A gray little figure stood waiting for
him in the dim dawn, as it had waited for him once
before. It was Meg, pressing something to her
heart.</p>

<p>"My child, I had hoped, I had planned to avoid
this for you," he said. "I hoped you would be
asleep."</p>

<div class="figcenter p2" style="width: 432px;">
<img src="images/illus067.jpg" width="432" height="700" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Meg presents the old fashion-plate to her friend.</span>&mdash;Page 61.</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">The child's lips moved, but she did not speak.
Abruptly stretching out the hand that she had held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
pressed against her bosom she put something into
his. It was the fashion-plate that had been to her
as her mother's portrait.</p>

<p>"Is that for me, Meg?" he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I'll keep it safe. I'll give it back to you, Meg,
when we meet again," he replied, tenderly folding
the battered print and laying it inside his pocket-book.</p>

<p>The child kept a stern silence.</p>

<p>"We'll meet again, Meg; I promise you that.
Poor little Meg!" he said feelingly. "It is hard
for you; but I will write to you&mdash;I will write. No
one will ever care for me as you have cared."</p>

<p>He kissed her, and as still she preserved the stern
silence of repressed grief he turned quickly away.
As he ran down he looked back and saw the child
watching him, with her face thrust through the
banisters.</p>

<p>He waved his hand to her and smiled. The next
moment the hall door clapped below, and from
above there came the sound of sobbing in the darkness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>A MYSTERIOUS VISIT.</h3>


<p>A few days after, in the early afternoon, as Meg
was sitting on the floor in her attic with the bundle
of articles given her by Mr. Standish spread out on
her lap, the books he had given her on the floor
around her, the door opened and Mrs. Browne
entered.</p>

<p>Meg had been silent and repellent since her
friend's departure. She had lived alone, communing
with her grief.</p>

<p>The landlady sat down on the child's bed and
began rocking herself backward and forward, uttering
faint moans.</p>

<p>Meg looked at her gravely and apparently unmoved.</p>

<p>"What are you crying for?" she asked at last,
when Mrs. Browne's moans became too emphatic
to be passed over in silence.</p>

<p>"I am going to lose you, Meg&mdash;after all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
years&mdash;There's a gentleman downstairs&mdash;waiting
to take you away. Oh! oh! oh!" moaned Mrs.
Browne.</p>

<p>"A gentleman&mdash;what gentleman?" asked Meg
with trembling eagerness, a light springing to her
eyes, for her thoughts had flown to her only friend.</p>

<p>"A kind gentleman&mdash;Mr. Fullbloom&mdash;You must
remember, Meg, as I always said&mdash;Mr. Fullbloom&mdash;pays
for you regular&mdash;regular as quarter-day comes,
he pays. Remember, as I always said it&mdash;And
now he's come to take you away from me&mdash;who
loves you as a mother."</p>

<p>"Is he coming to take me away to that school?"
asked Meg, sitting up straight, speaking in curt and
business-like tones.</p>

<p>"Yes, you're to go to a school&mdash;a grander school&mdash;a
ladies' school&mdash;and you'll forget me, who loved
you like a mother."</p>

<p>Meg did not answer. She began to prepare rapidly
for her departure. She was going to the
school; and this was the first step toward rejoining
Mr. Standish in the future.</p>

<p>She paid no heed to Mrs. Browne's feeble grieving
over the shabbiness of her wardrobe, her unmended
boots, and to the landlady's repeated injunctions
to "speak up for me who has been good to
you as a mother to the gentleman." Every week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Mrs. Browne protested, she had meant to buy Meg
a pretty dress and hat.</p>

<p>"What do I want with a fine dress at school for?
I am going to learn&mdash;that's what I am going to do.
I am going to be a lady," said Meg severely, locking
the writing-case, a present from Mr. Standish,
in which she had deposited her bundle of articles,
and wrapping her books in brown paper.</p>

<p>"The gentleman says you're to take nothing with
you except just what will go in a little bag," said
Mrs. Browne; "and I've brought you my best
hand-bag."</p>

<p>"I'll not go away without these things," said Meg
ardently. "I'll not go to school or nowhere without
them."</p>

<p>Mrs. Browne shook her head; but Meg was not to
be moved.</p>

<p>A few minutes' later, attired in her Sunday garments,
her feet shod in worn boots, Meg, carrying
her parcel, went downstairs, followed by Mrs.
Browne. In the best parlor stood the gentleman
she had once seen in Mr. Standish's room, and to
whom she had been introduced as the "little girl I
spoke to you of."</p>

<p>He still wore a frilled shirt and tapped a silver
snuffbox, and he looked at Meg with his head very
much on one side.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ready to go&mdash;ready to go!" he said in a quick
chirping voice. "Not crying, eh? not crying?"</p>

<p>Meg disengaged her hand to take the one proffered
to her.</p>

<p>"Can't take that parcel," said Mr. Fullbloom,
shaking his head. "Can't take it."</p>

<p>"Then I won't go away&mdash;I won't go to the school
without it," said Meg with fierce decision.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, tut!" said the lawyer. "What's inside
it? Lollipops, eh? lollipops?"</p>

<p>"No," said Meg, pale with eagerness; "it's
books and things&mdash;keepsakes. I'll never part with
them&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"Oh, hoity-toity!" said Mr. Fullbloom, then impressed
with the child's resolute look. "Well, well,"
he added, jerking his head to the other side, "perhaps
we'll find a place for it in the carriage."</p>

<p>Then once more Mrs. Browne lifted up her voice,
and weeping embraced Meg, who submitted to her
caress with a certain stiff-backed irresponsiveness.
It is probable that if Meg had been called under
other circumstances to leave the gloomy old boarding-house
and the boozy landlady, about whom
clustered all the associations of her childhood, she
would have felt the pang of the uprooting; but an
absorbing affection now filled her little heart, and
with it had come new hopes and ambition.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>A brougham was waiting at the door. Into it
she stepped, and after her, Mr. Fullbloom. The
next moment she was driving swiftly and silently
along. It was all very strange; yet Meg did not
feel surprised. Grief had lifted her unconsciously
to a higher level of expectation; all unknowingly
her attitude toward life was changed.</p>

<p>She was vaguely aware that she was the object
of her companion's amused and attentive observation.
For all his waggish ways and darting movements
Mr. Fullbloom had a shrewd and observant
mind. He was a lawyer, accustomed to note with
discriminating eye external signs that gave him
the clew to the personality of those with whom he
came in contact. It had grown to be a second
nature with him to take note of appearances. This
little maid's imperturbable demeanor before the
tears of Mrs. Browne, her quick, fearless trust in
him, her determined attitude toward the bundle
covered with brown paper, piqued his curiosity, and
moved a deeper interest in her than that which he
usually accorded to children. The clear-cut little
profile, he acknowledged, had a character of its
own. Meg's attitude, as she sat upright and somewhat
stiffly, partook of the same individuality.
Mr. Fullbloom noted every detail of the child's
dress&mdash;the well-worn turban hat crowning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
brown crop of hair, the shabby velveteen dress, the
weather-beaten jacket with its border of mangy fur,
the old boots, the darned worsted gloves covering
the hands that clasped the parcel.</p>

<p>"I think I know a little girl who is not very
sorry to leave the old house&mdash;not sorry," he said at
last, stooping forward and cocking his head with
that bird-like swiftness.</p>

<p>"I want to go to that school. Are we going
there now?" inquired Meg.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we are&mdash;perhaps we are not&mdash;perhaps
we are going to a fairy palace," replied Mr. Fullbloom
with a suggestive sidelong glance.</p>

<p>Meg looked at him smilelessly.</p>

<p>"There are no fairies," she said curtly. "Am I
going to that school?"</p>

<p>"Before I tell I want to know who gave you
those keepsakes&mdash;who was it? The clever young
gentleman who took such an interest in little Miss
Meg, and who had set his heart so much upon her
going to school&mdash;was it?" said Mr. Fullbloom facetiously,
laying his hand upon the bundle.</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish," answered Meg softly; and the
lawyer was astonished at the emotion perceptible
on the child's face. It seemed to quiver like the
chords of a harp upon which a hand is laid.</p>

<p>The silence was broken, and the lawyer began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
question. Meg was guarded and reticent in her
monosyllabic replies; but by a few leading questions
the lawyer got from her what he wished to
know.</p>

<p>He became satisfied that the picture Mr. Standish
had drawn of her isolation, neglect, and half-servile
position in the boarding-house was unexaggerated.
His veiled cross-examination was scarcely concluded
before the brougham drew up before a large house
overlooking a square, in which tall trees cast their
shade athwart the smoothly shaven turf.</p>

<p>"Was this grand house the lady's school?"
thought Meg.</p>

<p>A solemn man in black opened the door; an
imposing being in a gold-buttoned coat, plush
breeches, and silk stockings came forward, and
Meg by a dexterous move just rescued her parcel
from his officious clutches.</p>

<p>Mr. Fullbloom led her into a side room, saying
as he left her that he would be back immediately.
The firelight glowed upon frames and mirrors,
delicate porcelains, and blue satin hangings. For
a few moments the little Cinderella figure remained
standing immobile amid these surroundings, lost
in wonder, then the lawyer returned, and taking
her by the hand conducted her upstairs.</p>

<p>Who was she going to see now? Was she about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to be brought before the master or mistress of this
fairy palace?</p>

<p>Meg was aware of passing through a room larger
and more splendid than the one she had just left.
Then Mr. Fullbloom pushed open a door and ushered
her into another room furnished with bookcases
filled with books, a long table, and dark leather
chairs.</p>

<p>An old gentleman was sitting there. His chair
was against the window, so that his face was in
shadow, but his white hair shone. He was leaning
back; there was something rigid in his attitude;
his long white hands grasped the arms of the
chair.</p>

<p>"Here is the little girl," said Mr. Fullbloom.</p>

<p>The white-haired gentleman made no sign of
greeting, and did not speak for a moment; but a
close observer might have noticed, even in that
half-light, a slight twitch of the old hand.</p>

<p>"You are the little girl who spent all your life
in Mrs. Browne's boarding-house?" he said at last,
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Meg with a quiver in her voice.</p>

<p>In her heart she thought the elderly gentleman
was not to be compared in appearance with the
glittering footman; but his chill stare seemed to
freeze her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"You remember no other place? You have never
been to another?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I remember other places, but I have never lived
in another place," said Meg with her usual accuracy.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Meg."</p>

<p>"Meg what?"</p>

<p>"Browne," said Meg.</p>

<p>"No, that is not your name. Beecham is your
name. Don't forget&mdash;Beecham."</p>

<p>"Beecham?" repeated Meg, amazed.</p>

<p>"Take off your hat!" said her interlocutor.</p>

<p>Meg lifted her left hand to obey, but the elastic
caught in her hair, and she put her precious parcel
down to free her right hand.</p>

<p>"You were to take nothing out of that house,"
said the old gentleman sternly.</p>

<p>"I won't give them up&mdash;I won't!" cried Meg
with kindling countenance, and with hands outstretched
to protect her parcel.</p>

<p>"You won't!" repeated the old gentleman with
frozen severity. Mr. Fullbloom bent over his chair.
There was a whispered colloquy. Then the old
gentleman said in a voice that might have been
that of an audible icicle: "You may keep those
things if you do not ask for anything else."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not want anything else," said Meg with
energy.</p>

<p>"Turn to the light."</p>

<p>Meg, all rebellion smoothed from her countenance,
turned, obedient as a light-haunting flower, toward
the gleam of sunshine filtering through the heavy
curtains. The light fell caressingly on the spirited
little face in its renewed quietude.</p>

<p>"That will do," said the old gentleman; and he
fell into a brooding silence.</p>

<p>"This little girl wants to grow up a learned little
lady&mdash;a learned little lady," put in Mr. Fullbloom
cheerily after a pause.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what I want to be," answered Meg
with an eager nod.</p>

<p>"If you are sent to school," resumed the stranger
sternly, bending on the child a glance that seemed
to her to be one of aversion, "you must promise
never to speak of that time spent in the boarding-house.
You are to forget everything that happened
there, and everybody you met there."</p>

<p>"I'll not forget every one. There is one person I
will never forget&mdash;never," replied Meg with
energy.</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish, the young man who was her
friend. Can't ask her to forget him yet&mdash;can't do
that," put in Mr. Fullbloom in a tone of jaunty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
conciliation, shaking his head. "I feel sure Meg
will not speak about him."</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk about him," said Meg, her
voice instinct with the sacredness of her affection.</p>

<p>"Do you know how to read?" asked the old
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Meg briefly.</p>

<p>Her mysterious questioner opened a volume,
turned rapidly over the pages until he came to one
where a chapter ended. He passed his forefinger
over the page with a heaviness that widened the
delicate nail.</p>

<p>"When a chapter is done, it is done&mdash;you turn
the page." He suited the action to the words and
brought his palm down upon the book. "You
understand?" Meg nodded. "You begin another
chapter&mdash;the first chapter of your life is finished&mdash;you
understand?" Again Meg nodded. "It was
an ugly chapter&mdash;it remains with you to make the
next chapter a better and a finer one."</p>

<p>"I will not talk of anybody or of anything; but
I will always think of one person," persisted Meg,
intent upon making the conditions of the bargain
clear between her and this stranger.</p>

<p>"I cannot dictate to your thoughts," he replied.
"I want you to promise not to speak about the
past. What will you say when you are ques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>tioned
concerning it by teachers, schoolfellows, or
servants?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell them it's none of their business, that's
what I will tell them," said Meg, with spirit and a
relapse into a pronunciation that savored more of
Mrs. Browne's than of Mr. Standish's influence.</p>

<p>Mr. Fullbloom chuckled, but the old man remained
smileless.</p>

<p>"I have nothing more to add; take the child
away," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Fullbloom put out his hand to Meg. She
hesitated, looking toward the old gentleman to say
good-by.</p>

<p>Once more the child encountered a glance that
seemed to freeze her with its mysterious dislike
and she went out in silence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>MISS REEVES' ESTABLISHMENT FOR YOUNG LADIES.</h3>

<p>Moorhouse was a red brick mansion of Elizabethan
architecture, standing on the outskirts of the
old-fashioned town of Greyling, nestling under a
misty embattlement of distant downs. Tracts of
ferny solitudes and clumps of woodland lay beyond,
cloven by the long straight road that led Londonward.
It was difficult to imagine that such rural
peacefulness could be found at thirty miles distance
from the big metropolis.</p>

<p>Moorhouse was a boarding-school for young ladies.
It had gained a high reputation under the direction
of its present head-mistress, Miss Reeves, a middle-aged
lady of dignified appearance.</p>

<p>It was to Moorhouse Mr. Fullbloom was taking
Meg. The child had never gone on a railway journey.
The shriek and whistle of the engine as the
train dashed along startled her. She felt whirled
forward as by a demoniac force, and the pant of the
engine seemed to her like the audible heart-beat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
some dread monster. She sat rigid and silent in
the corner by the window as she passed out of the
station across the bridge-spanned river, past
squalid streets and roofs crowding below. At last
she emerged into more airy and peaceful surroundings.
The speed and pant still filled the limpid
daylight with terror; but Meg fought against her
unstrung nerves and compelled herself to look
out of the window. She was passing through a
pageantry of meadows lying in the mild sunshine
of the March afternoon; of cows grazing, of a pallid
golden light in the sky, veiled with fleecy purple
clouds. She heard the passing chirp of birds; she
caught glimpses of leafless woods spreading a tracery
of boughs against the brightness of the sky. There
were banks flickering with suggestions of primroses
under the hedges; undulating greenswards losing
themselves in blue distances. Through the terror
of that ride the influence of nature brought comfort
to her heart. An exhilarating sense that she was
traveling to a better land overcame fear. A house
in the distance, perched on a height, with the sunlight
on its windows, appeared to her a type of that
school to which she was journeying; a sort of magic
academy where she would grow worthy of becoming
Mr. Standish's friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Fullbloom coughed and Meg turned her head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
She caught the amused glance of her traveling
companion fixed upon her. The solicitor had been
dividing his attention between his paper and the
child by his side. Meg had been unconscious of
his investigation.</p>

<p>"Reach the school soon now," said the lawyer
with his accustomed airy nod.</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," replied Meg.</p>

<p>"Want to be a learned little lady, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is just what I want to be," Meg
answered in an eager tone; "learned as a lady."</p>

<p>"Well, so you will be&mdash;excellent school that of
Miss Reeves&mdash;learn to dance, play the piano, to
speak French, German&mdash;any amount of accomplishments.
Bless me, there will be no talking to
you in a year or two. Have to study hard, though."</p>

<p>Meg nodded in token of her readiness to face any
amount of study.</p>

<p>"Don't forget your name&mdash;Beecham&mdash;it is not
Browne. Madam was not your mother, or for the
matter of that any relation," said the lawyer.</p>

<p>"I knew she was not my mother," said Meg in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"No, indeed; light and darkness could not be
more unlike."</p>

<p>"You knew my mother?" cried Meg, a flush
kindling her cheeks.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew her a little," replied the lawyer guardedly.
"You are like her about the mouth and
eyes."</p>

<p>"I am not a bit like her," Meg answered in a
tone of offense. "She was beautiful&mdash;like an
angel."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was beautiful," acquiesced Mr. Fullbloom.</p>

<p>Meg looked at the lawyer with a new expression.
A halo surrounded his brow, for he had seen her
mother.</p>

<p>"Did the old gentleman I saw to-day know her
too?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>The lawyer put up his finger and wagged his
head.</p>

<p>"Little girls must not ask questions. They must
be seen, not heard," he replied, taking up his paper
and growing absorbed in its contents.</p>

<p>He did not speak again until the train shortly
after stopped at Greyling station.</p>

<p>Before long they had reached Moorhouse, and
the door had opened for Meg. As she passed
through the portal of the red brick mansion she
felt as if she stood upon the threshold of a sanctuary.
This sense deepened when, a few moments
later, she was confronted by a majestic lady, whom
the lawyer introduced to her as Miss Reeves, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
looked at her kindly and scrutinizingly. After a
low-voiced colloquy with Mr. Fullbloom at the other
end of the room, Miss Reeves took her by the hand,
saying:</p>

<p>"Your guardian has confided you to my care. I
hope, my dear child, that we may both learn soon
to love and trust each other."</p>

<p>Meg took with confidence the extended hand.
Shortly after, Mr. Fullbloom bade her an airy farewell,
and she followed Miss Reeves into a room
where a meal was going on.</p>

<p>"Miss Grantley and Madame Vallaria," said the
head-mistress addressing the two ladies sitting at
either end of the table, "let me introduce to you a
new pupil, and to you, young ladies, a new school-fellow&mdash;Miss
Margaret Beecham. Ursula Grey, let
her sit beside you; look after her, she is a stranger."</p>

<p>The room swam around Meg as she took her seat
near a girl with a pleasant rosy face and bright
eyes shining behind a pair of clever-looking spectacles.
The child fancied she detected muffled
exclamations, and that on all sides a stare was
turned upon her which was not friendly.</p>

<p>The young ladies appeared to her beautifully
dressed. They wore pretty brooches and necklaces
of colored beads; their shining hair fell about their
necks, and they had delicate bits of lace round their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
throats and wrists. One girl appeared to Meg so
beautiful that she forgot everything in the delight
of looking at her.</p>

<p>She was roused by a nudge of the elbow.</p>

<p>"Miss Grantley is speaking to you," said her
spectacled neighbor. The young lady's lips were
quivering with restrained smiles.</p>

<p>"Miss Beecham, will you take a glass of milk or
a cup of cocoa?" said the lady at the head of the
table.</p>

<p>Meg looked blankly in the direction of the
speaker.</p>

<p>"Is not your name Beecham?" said this lady with
a shade of annoyance in her voice.</p>

<p>Meg shook her head in the negative; then suddenly
remembering the warning she had received
not to forget:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Beecham&mdash;that's my name," she said hurriedly,
with the vivid nod that usually accompanied
her assertions.</p>

<p>A titter went round the table.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Miss Grantley severely.</p>

<p>Meg sat stiff and upright.</p>

<p>"Will you have milk or cocoa?" repeated Miss
Grantley.</p>

<p>"Cocoa," blurted out Meg with monosyllabic
brevity, in her confusion forgetting her manners.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>She was intensely aware of the nudgings going
on around her; of subdued fits of laughter shaking
some of the young ladies; of the surprised stare of
others. She caught Miss Grantley's cold
glance.</p>

<p>Meg seized with both hands the cup passed on
to her and hurriedly gulped down some of its
contents.</p>

<p>As she put it down she again encountered shocked
and amazed glances. An embarrassed misgiving
fell upon her. Breaking her bread into small
morsels she slowly munched, gazing down into
her plate.</p>

<p>When she became aware of a general pushing
back of chairs and of rising about her, Meg stood
up. She knew the teacher was saying grace. Her
spectacled neighbor then nodded.</p>

<p>"Come along," she said, and Meg followed.</p>

<p>The girls were pouring into another room. They
at once surrounded Meg. The whispers became
audible.</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Who brought her?"</p>

<p>"Where did she come from?"</p>

<p>To Meg's surprise, one of the girls approached her
and said with familiar cordiality:</p>

<p>"What is your name&mdash;your real name, I mean?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"My real name?" repeated Meg. She was standing
inflexibly upright near a table.</p>

<p>"The name you were called by before to-day?"
said her interrogator.</p>

<p>"You did not recognize your name when you
were called Beecham&mdash;what is your real name?"
said another.</p>

<p>Meg did not answer for a moment. She remembered
her promise to the mysterious white-haired
stranger. Then she said huskily:</p>

<p>"What does it signify what name I had before?"</p>

<p>Again she paused.</p>

<p>"Then you had another name?" said the pretty
girl in a thin, high voice. "How very romantic!"</p>

<p>"Don't tease her&mdash;what does it signify?" put in
Ursula.</p>

<p>"What does it signify?" was repeated all round
in what Meg fancied a not unkindly tone. She
took courage.</p>

<p>"What is in a name?" demanded one of the girls.</p>

<p>"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet
would it not?" said another.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Meg, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Where did you live!" questioned one.</p>

<p>Meg remained mute. Again her promise to the
mysterious stranger sealed her lips.</p>

<p>"Up a tree," suggested one.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Second branch," said another with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Letters to you came addressed 'Miss What's-her-name,
second branch, fourth tree, on the right
side of the road,'" cried a third.</p>

<p>This description of Meg's late abode was greeted
by peals of laughter.</p>

<p>"Visitors climbed up," suggested another.</p>

<p>"Why do you say those things?" asked Meg,
looking round on the laughing faces. "I am come
here to learn lessons&mdash;to grow up to be a lady.
That's what I come for."</p>

<p>"A lady!" echoed all around her.</p>

<p>"A lady is born a lady," said a tall girl who had
not spoken hitherto. She had a high nose and a
voice of ice.</p>

<p>"My mother was a lady," said Meg.</p>

<p>"Your mother!" was echoed all around.</p>

<p>Meg did not answer; words seemed to tremble
on her lips as she gazed on her tormentors.</p>

<p>"Is your dress her taste?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Did she teach you to say 'Cocoa' like that,
without saying 'if you please'?" asked another,
mimicking Meg's answer to Miss Grantley.</p>

<p>"My mother taught me nothing&mdash;she is dead,"
said Meg slowly.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>Then the tormentors began again.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you sure you would know a lady if you saw
one?"</p>

<p>"Would you call the grocer's wife a lady because
she wears a silk dress?" demanded the Roman-nosed
young lady in her chilly voice.</p>

<p>"No," said Meg with concentration.</p>

<p>"Does a lady go about playing the street-organ?"
asked a fat, stupid-faced girl.</p>

<p>"No," again said Meg fiercely. Then addressing
the assembly generally, but looking especially at
the high-nosed young lady, she went on: "Why do
you want to know all those things about me? It's
idle curiosity&mdash;that's what I call it. And if my
dress is ugly, what is that to you? I come here to
learn lessons and to be a lady."</p>

<p>"But do you know what it is to be a lady?" replied
the girl.</p>

<p>"One is born, not made a lady," said another.</p>

<p>"If," said Meg, trembling with energy, looking
round on her persecutors, "to be a born lady makes
one laugh at another because she's badly dressed,
and to mock her because she's not got fine manners,
then to be a born lady is to be vulgar and cruel&mdash;that's
what I think."</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence; then the stupid-looking
girl, coming close to Meg and thrusting her
face near hers, said in a jeering drawl:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw you and your mother selling matches in
Bond Street last Easter holidays. Your mother
had a red handkerchief round her head and a
monkey under her arm."</p>

<p>"That is a falsehood!" said Meg. Up flashed the
little brown hand and came down with a slap on
the dull, mocking face.</p>

<p>There was a hubbub.</p>

<p>Cries of "She's a savage!" "A gypsy!"</p>

<p>"We will tell Miss Reeves," was vociferated on
all sides.</p>

<p>Above the tumult rose the voice of Ursula:</p>

<p>"You deserved that slap, Laura Harris. Miss
Beecham had told us her mother was dead. She
has been teased too much."</p>

<p>A bell sounded and the head-mistress, followed
by the other teachers and the servants, entered the
room.</p>

<p>"Silence, young ladies," said Miss Reeves.</p>

<p>Prayer-time had come at Moorhouse.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>AT SCHOOL.</h3>


<p>Meg was going through the ordeal that her friend
had set for her, and she strung herself to endurance.
She felt she was tabooed by these fashionable young
ladies, and she fiercely anticipated their neglect.
She avoided them; she rejected Ursula's advances
with impatience.</p>

<p>For awhile some of the girls felt a temptation to
bait this little badger, but at last either the freshness
or the excitement of the sport died away.
Perhaps, too, a certain amount of fear restrained
them. The slap administered to Laura Harris had
made an impression, and it was considered advisable
not to goad the "savage" beyond bounds. Meg
after awhile was very much left alone.</p>

<p>She was an outcast, and she felt homesick for the
London cage from which she had flitted, and which
the presence of a friend had cheered. For the first
time, also, she realized her ignorance, and with
resolute heroism she set herself to learn. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
worked with astonishing zeal. At her books and
lessons Meg did not feel so lonely. At church and
in her walks through the pleasant country lanes the
sense of her absolute isolation was lifted. In recreation
hours she sat apart from her schoolfellows.
There was a yew tree on the outskirts of the playground
into which she climbed to read Goldsmith's
"Animated Nature." She began its perusal for the
sake of the donor; then, gradually, this book of
wonder fascinated her. The description it gave
of strange, beautiful creatures, of birds especially,
enthralled her. She gathered from the pages hints
of far-away countries that called to her like a voice.
This little town-bred heart was seized with a passionate
love of nature and a foolish love of wild
flowers. As she formed one of the regiment of
girls who tramped, two and two, through the country
lanes, the beauty of nature seemed to comfort
Meg as if the touch of a reassuring hand were laid
upon her heart. She would almost forget, then,
that she was an object of mockery or patronage to
her fellows. In the beautiful old church she felt
nearly happy. "I am out of school," she would
say to herself. The voice of the organ took her
immensely. It seemed to be a voice talking to God.
She liked the clergyman also. He was an old gentleman
who appeared to her to be endowed with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
benevolence. She thought his sermons marvels of
eloquence. When, in answer to her long stare, his
eye sometimes rested upon her, she felt immensely
distinguished and honored.</p>

<p>The teachers of Moorhouse were as much puzzled
concerning Meg as were the girls. She knew so
much of some subjects and so little of others. Miss
Reeves, after a careful examination of the new
pupil's acquirements, declared that Meg might beat
the girls of the upper class in knowledge of some
parts of history, and in familiarity with some of
Shakespeare's plays; while the lower classes might
overmaster her in the elements of arithmetic,
geography, and other subjects.</p>

<p>Mr. Foster, the arithmetic master, a lank man
with a large nose and a long neck, who looked like
an innocent vulture, and who had never been known
to give a bad mark, contenting himself with feebly
rubbing out the mistakes on the slates presented
to him, was bewildered by Meg's absolute ignorance
of the rules of arithmetic, and by her dependence
upon her fingers for counters.</p>

<p>"Miss Beecham is a <i>table-rase</i>, as was the great
philosopher Descartes before he began to observe
for the sake of his method," said the professor to
Miss Reeves, with forefinger uplifted, for Mr.
Foster was proud of making little pedantic jokes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Vallaria, the middle-aged lady who
superintended the music of the establishment, teaching
piano and singing from morning till night, was
divided between admiration for Meg's correct ear
and determination to learn, and despair over the
stiffness of her fingers and her ignorance of the
first elements of music. The signora was hot-tempered;
her nerves were jarred by listening to
incessant practice.</p>

<p>"No, no, it is impossible! I will not teach you&mdash;I
will refuse&mdash;I will say to Miss Reeves that I
cannot!" She sometimes exclaimed, addressing
Meg: "Your fingers are like the chop sticks the
Chinese do use for eating. You thump&mdash;thump&mdash;thump!
I hear it in my sleep. It ever gives me
the nightmare." Sometimes Mme. Vallaria relented
and with voluble heartiness would exclaim: "Oh,
Povera! your leetle heart is set to learn; you are
so courageous; and your ear it is exact, like a
machine made to catch the sounds. Yes, I will
teach you&mdash;you shall learn it yet&mdash;the piano&mdash;never
fear!"</p>

<p>Mr. Eyre, the shy and eminent professor who
came down twice a week from London to take
classes of history and English literature of younger
and elder pupils, would alternately pass from delight
to annoyance at Meg's answers. Her indifference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to dates appeared to him a sort of moral deficiency&mdash;it
amounted to contempt. Her power of realizing
historical facts and characters in which she took an
interest was vivid, as if she had been a spectator
of the events described, and had a personal acquaintance
with the actors therein. He vowed she spoke
of Julius Cæsar as if she knew him, and of his
murder as if it had happened yesterday and was
the subject of a leader in this morning's <i>Times</i>. He
was appalled and puzzled, he exhorted, he raged;
but his eye rested expectantly upon Meg when her
companions floundered behind, and the dullness of
the class was relieved for him by the audacity of
her answers.</p>

<p>"You ought to go up to London to see the coronation,"
he said to her one day when the theme of
the lesson was Queen Elizabeth's reign, and Meg
surpassed herself in the brilliancy of her descriptive
replies and the astounding incorrectness of her
dates.</p>

<p>"What coronation?" asked Meg.</p>

<p>"That of Queen Elizabeth."</p>

<p>"But she is dead and buried in Westminster
Abbey," Meg rejoined blankly, being dismally
dense in apprehending a joke.</p>

<p>"Is she?" replied Mr. Eyre with feigned astonishment,
and as was his wont when he bantered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
pupils, he set about biting what remained of his
nails and scribbled the lessons to be learned in the
following week.</p>

<p>"Let her go on! She will go forever and ever
backward till she is stopped by the pyramid of
Ghizeh!" he remarked another day as Meg placed
the date of Cromwell a century too early, and was
sending it back another hundred years when she
found she was wrong.</p>

<p>Miss Grantley, the English and geography
teacher to the younger class, was antagonistically
chilly in her treatment of Meg. The child felt she
was disliked, and with that precise and unsympathetic
teacher her deficiencies came out flagrantly.
Signora Vallaria's voluble wailings, Dr. Grey's
jokes, did not dispirit Meg as did Miss Grantley's
frosty censoriousness.</p>

<p>Meg was solitary, and in her solitude she grew
defiant and repellent. Her heart suffered from the
atmosphere of repression. As far as outward appearances
went she resembled her comrades; she
was dressed like her fellow-pupils, her wardrobe
having been replenished under Miss Reeves' direction;
but inwardly she was not of them. She sat
among them like an owl among sparrows.</p>

<p>She observed them. As she had watched the
hubbub of the lodging-house, so she now watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the routine of the school. The girls of the first
class, tall, elegantly dressed, appeared to her like
young goddesses.</p>

<p>Some of those nodded to her kindly as they
passed, and she returned the salute awkwardly
without a smile.</p>

<p>Among the girls who had tormented her on her
first night, a group, headed by Miss Rosamond
Pinkett, the cold-eyed, straight-backed, Roman-nosed
young lady, kept up an aggressive attitude.
It still appeared to Miss Pinkett that a degradation
had been inflicted on the school by the introduction
of the "savage," and she ignored Meg with contemptuous
coldness. This young lady's bosom
friend, Gwendoline Lister, the beauty of the school,
had a nature addicted to romance. Her mind was
like a story-book in which every page contained a
thrilling incident of which she was usually the
heroine.</p>

<p>The sudden appearance of Meg, in a costume
that suggested the dress of a poor tradesman's
child, her fierce refusal to betray anything concerning
her antecedents except the reiteration that her
mother was a lady, fired the beauty's fancy. Meg,
she imagined, was the scion of a noble family,
stolen by gypsies, found at last, and sent here to be
educated.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Daughter of a ballet-dancer, my dear, you
mean," Miss Pinkett said with an icy sniff. "That
ridiculous drawing speaks volumes."</p>

<p>The drawing to which Miss Pinkett alluded, and
from which the Beauty had evolved her romance,
was an attempt made by Meg to repeat from
memory that dear fashion plate, which she had
given away.</p>

<p>She had rudely drawn a small-mouthed, large-eyed
face, the head wreathed with roses, the dress covered
with roses. Underneath she had written in Roman
characters, "My mother." This drawing had been
found in Goldsmith's "Animated Nature," taken
out by prying fingers, and had been passed from
hand to hand. Where others had found food for
mockery, Miss Lister had found food for her imagination.</p>

<p>Meg had come on the scene as Miss Pinkett was
in the act of examining the sketch. With a cry she
had snatched it out of the enemy's grasp, and, tearing
it to bits, she had flung herself from the presence
of the girls.</p>

<p>Ursula continued the defense of the stranger, and
made advances to Meg, which the child persistently
refused.</p>

<p>"Why won't you take my sweets?" Ursula asked
once in a piqued tone.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't want them," said Meg with jerky abruptness.</p>

<p>"Why? Is it because you have none to give in
return?" demanded Ursula bluntly.</p>

<p>"I don't want them&mdash;that is all!" answered Meg.</p>

<p>"It is pride&mdash;nothing but pride!" said Ursula,
turning away with a displeased gleam of her spectacles.</p>

<p>A few days later an incident happened which
showed that Meg was not all indifferent to kindness.
The spring had come and decked with lavish
waste of blossoms disgraced corners as well as more
favored places. It had rimmed with a fringe of
velvet wallflower the top of the arid garden wall.
The orange and brown blooms spread in the sunlight,
swayed in the breeze, attracted the murmuring
bees, and sang the praise of spring in delicate
wafts of perfume.</p>

<p>"How delicious those wallflowers smell," said
Ursula, sniffing the air with head thrown back.
"It is a shame they should be unpluckable. I wish
I had a handful."</p>

<p>Meg heard the wish as she sat perched on the yew
tree. When Ursula turned away she abandoned her
leafy throne, and swung herself from one of the
branches on to the trellis that covered the wall. It
was a high wall, but she climbed it with the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>cision
of a woodland animal, here grasping the
trellis, there planting her foot on some bit of projecting
masonry. "You'll fall!" cried a chorus of
voices. "To climb that wall is absolutely forbidden,
Miss Beecham," called out Miss Pinkett's
voice. "I will go and tell Miss Grantley," cried
Laura Harris, setting off at a run. Meg, undismayed
by warnings and threats, pursued her quest.</p>

<p>A moment later Ursula felt a gentle touch on the
elbow, and a fragrant bunch of brown blossoms
was thrust into her hand.</p>

<p>"Meg, you did not!" she cried with amazed
spectacles, gazing at the child, who bore marks of
her recent encounter with the perils of the wall.</p>

<p>Meg nodded.</p>

<p>Ursula buried her nose into the flowers with a
hesitating expression as Miss Grantley came up, followed
by girls.</p>

<p>"Miss Beecham, go indoors at once! You shall
stay in this afternoon for this unlady-like and disobedient
conduct. Ursula, those flowers must be
given up!"</p>

<div class="figcenter p2" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus103.jpg" width="700" height="426" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Meg pulls the forbidden flowers.</span>&mdash;Page 94.</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">Meg went indoors without a murmur, and zealously
devoted herself to the task set her as expiation
of her offense. She took pleasure in its
difficulty. She was glad the day was so beautiful,
that the room was full of sunshine, and the wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
puffs of wind brought in messages from the
odorous sweetness of the day. She was proud of
being punished for Ursula's sake. It seemed to put
her on a more equal footing, as if repaying her for
past kindness.</p>

<p>Another incident that followed shortly after the
wall-climbing episode proved that Meg's sense of
loyalty survived amid the withering influence of
loveless criticisms around her.</p>

<p>Miss Gwendoline Lister, because of her beauty,
was a personality in the school. She suffered the
penalties of celebrity. Stories were current concerning
her. One averred that she had been found
dissolved in tears on the discovery of a freckle upon
her nose. Another rumor was current that the
Beauty spent the afternoon of wet half-holidays
locked up in the room she and Miss Pinkett shared
in common arranging and dressing her hair in
various fashions, enhancing her charms with rouge
and powder, and trying on her ball dress.</p>

<p>Perhaps this report arose from the fact of a rouge
pot having been found in the school. Some averred
it was the property of Miss Lister, others declared
its contents had been used by the young ladies who
had taken part in a theatrical entertainment given
on the occasion of breaking up for the holidays.</p>

<p>Meg, in her isolation, took no interest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
"rouge pot controversy." One afternoon, to her
surprise, she was beckoned by Miss Pinkett into the
room shared by her and Gwendoline.</p>

<p>The Beauty was standing near the dressing-table,
a radiant vision clothed in white, with hair unbound,
wreathed with roses, and with roses in the
bodice of her dress.</p>

<p>For a moment Meg remained struck dumb with
admiration, then came a sudden revolution. In her
wide experience of life in the boarding-house she
had known an obscure member of the theatrical
profession. This little slip of the foot lights, who
spent her life in alternate squalor and fairy-like
splendor, had on one or two occasions dressed herself
up for Meg's benefit. The child had grown to
know cheeks bedabbled with paint and eyes outlined
with bismuth. The face of Miss Lister brought
back this acquaintance of bygone times.</p>

<p>"Well, what do I look like?" said Gwendoline,
with her head cocked on one side and her finger-tips
caressing the roses in her bodice. "You know,
little monkey, you are not to tell."</p>

<p>Miss Pinkett watched the effect on Meg with cold
curiosity.</p>

<p>"You look much prettier as you are every day,"
said Meg.</p>

<p>"Do I look like your mother?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"My mother!" repeated the child, and she began
to tremble.</p>

<p>"I copied the portrait you drew, roses and all,"
said the Beauty.</p>

<p>"My mother never painted her cheeks; she never
put black under her eyes. You are like a Christy
minstrel painted pink and white&mdash;that's what you
are like!" said Meg, with the concentration of fury
in her voice. She turned, unlocked the door, and
slammed it behind her.</p>

<p>As she emerged out of the room the dressing bell
for tea rang, and she encountered a group of girls
waiting outside. They cried breathlessly:</p>

<p>"What are they doing inside?"</p>

<p>"Is not Gwendoline dressing up? Does she rouge
her cheeks?"</p>

<p>"I saw a bit of a white dress."</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;I did! Tell us, Meg&mdash;Meg!"</p>

<p>But Meg did not answer. She tore along the
passage and up the stairs till she came to a solitary
attic. She flung herself down on the floor and hammered
the insensate boards with her fists. In her
untamed heart she would have wished to wipe the
insult from her mother's memory by thus maltreating
the painted cheeks of Miss Lister.</p>

<p>When the tea bell rang Meg went downstairs.</p>

<p>"Where are Miss Pinkett and Miss Lister?" asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Miss Reeves, after she had said grace, glancing down
the table.</p>

<p>"They have not come down yet from their room,
madam," said the attending parlor-maid.</p>

<p>"Miss Lister is dressing up. Miss Beecham was
there&mdash;she knows," said Laura Harris, who might
be relied upon for giving information on the doings
of the other girls.</p>

<p>"Miss Beecham knows!" repeated some other
voices.</p>

<p>"Miss Lister puts paint on her cheeks," resumed
Laura, growing more explicit.</p>

<p>"I hope not!" said Miss Reeves, with an anxious
brow, and her eye rested upon Meg.</p>

<p>"I heard it said before by Miss Reeves' young
laidees," put in Signora Vallaria, rolling her dark
eyes. "Tell, my leetle Meg, what they were doing,
the silly young laidees, when they call you in?"</p>

<p>At this moment Miss Pinkett and Gwendoline
entered. The Beauty's face was shining with soap.</p>

<p>"What were you doing in your room, young
ladies?" asked Miss Reeves gravely.</p>

<p>"I suppose, madam, Miss Beecham has been
telling," replied Miss Pinkett.</p>

<p>"No, we are waiting for her answer to the question
I have just put to you."</p>

<p>Meg was conscious of every eye being turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
upon her&mdash;Miss Reeves sternly questioning, Miss
Pinkett coldly supercilious, Gwendoline, with pursed
lips, imploring. She stood up, her little red lips
closed tightly, her heart fiercely divided between a
desire for vengeance and a sense of loyalty. After
a pause she said:</p>

<p>"They called me into the room to make fun of a
portrait of my mother which I had drawn."</p>

<p>A murmur of comical disappointment from the
girls round the table, an expression of relief on the
faces of the two culprits, greeted this answer.</p>

<p>"It was such an absurd portrait, madam," said
Miss Pinkett in an explanatory tone; "a lady
suffering from the mumps wearing a wreath of
roses."</p>

<p>A titter went round the table.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Miss Reeves seriously. "It is unkind
to laugh at the child. Sit down, young ladies."</p>

<p>"It was awfully good of you, Meg, not to tell
about me," said Gwendoline that evening, when she
got Meg alone. "I am awfully obliged. I am sorry
I offended you. Will you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Meg emphatically, turning her back
upon the Beauty and walking stiffly away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>THE SCHOOL ANNUAL.</h3>


<p>Ursula had founded the "Moorhouse Annual."
The volume appeared every year just before the
midsummer holidays. It consisted of poems and
stories by the young ladies, copied in Miss Clara
Maxton's beautiful copperplate writing, and edited
by Ursula.</p>

<p>Ursula was editress, illustrator, and chief contributor.
The history of the courtship, squabbles,
friendships, and adventures of Mr. Gander and Miss
Chilblane, chiefly related in pen-and-ink drawings,
with commentaries appended beneath, by Ursula,
was a leading feature of the periodical.</p>

<p>The would-be contributors to the annual usually
assembled some Saturday afternoon in May, to read
aloud their MSS. and submit them to the editorial
judgment.</p>

<p>The important Saturday had arrived, and Ursula
and her staff were assembled, with Miss Reeves'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
permission, in the smaller schoolroom. Ursula sat
at the head of the table in an impressive armchair;
the spectacles astride her <i>retroussé</i> nose seemed
critically brilliant.</p>

<p>Meg slunk in, and sat at the window within
earshot.</p>

<p>Gwendoline had asked her on entering, MS. in
hand, if she was going to read a story. "I am sure
you could write a most bewitching story about that
beautiful lady," the Beauty had averred.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" said Meg, retreating into the
veranda.</p>

<p>She had crept back in time to hear Laura Harris
read her tale. It appeared to be the history of a
confectioner, who owned a famous west-end shop,
which was in vogue with the fashionable and
wealthy. Ladies sat there and feasted. The description
of its charms had apparently such an
overwhelming attraction for the authoress that she
could not prevail on her pen to quit it and pass on
with her story. There was a gigantic wedding-cake,
with a sugar-almond top, fully a yard high.
The cream puffs, the jam tarts, the ices, the chocolates,
the sweets were piled on with profusion.</p>

<p>The conclusion of this story was not arrived at.</p>

<p>Ursula rapped the table with her paper-knife.</p>

<p>"Story declined with thanks," she said briefly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" asked Laura indignantly.</p>

<p>"Because, notwithstanding the delicious cakes,
we consider it in bad taste," replied Ursula, using
the editorial "we" with fine effect.</p>

<p>"Miss Grant, have you a story to submit to us
for the forthcoming annual?"</p>

<p>Miss Grant had made a hit the year before by
her story of "The Ghostly Postman," who knocked
in the ordinary way, and sent summons of death
by the letter box.</p>

<p>An audible shiver ran through the audience as
she now unrolled her MS., and in a deep voice read
the title&mdash;"The Midnight Yell."</p>

<p>The story told of a beautiful country house, on a
moor, in which there was a haunted chamber. Whoever
entered that room at night never came out
alive. At midnight a yell would ring through
the mansion&mdash;unearthly, blood curdling. When the
chamber was broken into the guest was always
found dead, with arms outstretched and eyes starting
out of their sockets. Who uttered that midnight
yell?&mdash;was it the living or the dead? The
visitor or the ghost? None could tell. Some said
it was an old hag who haunted the chamber, some
said it was a beautiful white lady; but it was
generally reported to be a murdered queen.</p>

<p>A sigh greeted this story.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Accepted," said Ursula, in a business-like tone.</p>

<p>"Will it be illustrated?" inquired the authoress
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes; probably with a spectral donkey braying,"
said Ursula.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I cannot allow that!" said the authoress.</p>

<p>"We decline to hold communications about the
MSS., refused or accepted," replied Ursula, bringing
her paper-knife sharply down upon the table.</p>

<p>"Miss Lister's story," she demanded.</p>

<p>"It is entitled," said Gwendoline in a falsetto
voice, "'The Lover's Grave.'" The Beauty proceeded
to read how a gypsy with weird, mystic, somber
eyes, and serpent-like, coiling, blue-black hair,
had scanned the shell-like palm of a lovely Venetian
maiden with golden tresses, and warned her with
strange fatal mutterings that to her love and death
would come hand in hand. Careless of the muttered
prophecy, the Venetian damsel with hair like
bullion, and clad in a rich violet velvet gown, and
with a necklace of pearls clasped about her lily-white
throat, set off every morning in her gondola
to look for the gallant whom she could love. One
day the predicted lover came in another gondola;
he was beautiful as Apollo. His mustache was
long and silky, his eyes liquid and violet; he had
an air of combined tenderness and strength. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
gondolas drifted toward each other, impelled by
fate. The lady rose impulsively; so did the gentleman.
They endeavored to embrace. As they did
so, both fell into the water. For awhile they
floated on the blue-green flood, smiling seraphically
at each other, then they subsided gracefully, and
were drowned, and ever after that spot was called
"The Lovers' Grave."</p>

<p>"It will make a pretty picture," said Ursula. "I
can see the two drowning with that set seraphic
smile, as if they liked it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gwendoline, who never saw a joke,
"it will make a lovely picture."</p>

<p>"I have written a poem," said Miss Blanche
Hathers modestly, taking out a roll of paper tied
with bows of pink satin ribbon.</p>

<p>A hum of approbation greeted this announcement.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Ursula, with the freezing brevity
of the editor.</p>

<p>"The poem is called 'A Lament,' perhaps it
might be more appropriately called 'A Deserted
Maiden's Prayer.'"</p>

<p>Ursula nodded. Miss Hathers began effectively:</p>

<p>
<span class="i2">"Oh! star of even</span><br />
<span class="i2">My heart is riven,</span><br />
<span class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>Come thou down and shine</span><br />
<span class="i2">In these eyes of mine;</span><br />
<span class="i2">'Twill draw him back."</span>
</p>

<p>Ursula, forgetting editorial dignity, completed the
couplet, amid giggles and laughter:</p>

<p>
<span class="i2">"And his cheek I'll smack."</span>
</p>

<p>The discomfited poetess folded up her effusion.
The next line was:</p>

<p>
<span class="i2">"On dreamy track,"</span>
</p>

<p>and it was only the first verse.</p>

<p>
<span class="i2">"'Twill draw him back,</span><br />
<span class="i2">On dreamy track."</span>
</p>

<p>she repeated in an injured voice.</p>

<p>"Never mind on what track&mdash;we must shunt him,"
said Ursula with decision. "Any more MSS.?" she
inquired, scanning the assembled contributors.</p>

<p>There came a rustle of many pages.</p>

<p>Miss Margaret Smith submitted the story of "The
First Ball-dress," which had a high moral; it was
accepted, and was voted lovely. Miss Sarah Robbins
contributed "The Vampire Schoolmistress," an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
awful tale of a teacher, whose pupils all died mysteriously&mdash;"sucked
like oranges," Ursula suggested.
One young lady gave an account of her trip to
Paris, which contained vivid descriptions of bonnets
and capes, and some obscure allusions to the
galleries.</p>

<p>"My story is entitled 'The Noble Heiress,'" said
Miss Pinkett. In a lisping, fine voice the young
lady read the story of a wealthy damsel, who lived
in a beautiful house, exquisitely furnished.</p>

<p>As Portia was at Belmont, so was this heiress
sought in marriage by many suitors. It was said
that besides her wealth she possessed "love-powders;"
for all who saw her loved her. But she
was as sensible as she was rich and beautiful, and
she kept her heart in check. It was only when the
eldest son of a marquis came forward to woo her
that she allowed herself to love. Wealth and
nobility, the sensible heiress felt, was the true
marriage sung of by poets from all ages. The wedding
presents were numerous&mdash;the author was
lavish in descriptions of the diamonds, the rubies,
the emeralds. The wedding-dress was a charming
costume, which Miss Pinkett described with much
fervor.</p>

<p>Meg, who had sat still all the time with her chin
in her hands, like a surly little exile from the circle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
looked as if the foolish tales irritated her. Suddenly,
in a clear, abrupt voice she said:</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you my story?"</p>

<p>"Your story?" echoed the girls, amazed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ursula.</p>

<p>"Do!" exclaimed Gwendoline.</p>

<p>"It is the story of a toad," said Meg.</p>

<p>"Of a toad!" repeated Gwendoline in dismay.</p>

<p>"There was once upon a time a toad," Meg began,
breathing heavily&mdash;taking no notice of the interruption.</p>

<p>"It was ugly, lonely, and always in danger of
being kicked and crushed; but it had splendid eyes,
like jewels. At night it liked to crawl out and
look up at the beautiful stars. Every one who saw
it," Meg went on with more concentration, "looked
at it with disgust. The toad used to make its way
to the edge of the still water and look at itself,
and think 'how they hate me.' It envied the frogs
which croaked and could jump, while it could only
crawl.</p>

<p>"Down in the water below the ground lived the
great mother of all the toads, and this little toad
went down to find her, for it wished to ask her why
it had ever been born? The mother of all the toads
was immensely large. She had bigger and more
beautiful eyes than any other toad. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
like soft precious stones, and round each eye was a
circle of light like a ring of gold. The little toad
sat before her and said:</p>

<p>"'Why have I been born? Why should I be
crushed and beaten, and looked at with disgust?
Why do the children put out their little red lips at
me? They hate and fear me. Sometimes when they
see me they step back and go headlong into the
water. I have not even power to punish them.'</p>

<p>"And the mother of all the toads did not answer,
she only blinked. She showed no sympathy at all,
and never looked at the little toad.</p>

<p>"Once the toad thought it would do a kind thing.
It lived near a garden, and in it there was a child
who had a pet flower, and when the child went
away the toad took care of the flower, brought
water to it, scratched the earth, and took all the
insects away.</p>

<p>"When the child returned the flower was more
beautiful than before. But when it saw the toad,
it stamped its little foot, crying 'Kill it! kill it!'
and the gardener gave the poor toad a kick with
his nailed boot on its tender side, and threw it,
almost killed, into the water. So the little toad
said 'I will never like anybody again, and I will
never do a kind thing.'</p>

<p>"Its heart grew wicked." Meg put emphasis on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
this last word. "It had teeth to bite, it croaked its
ugliest, and it had just one longing to see something
uglier than itself. One day it saw this thing.
It was a pug dog&mdash;petted, and fed, and caressed, and
wearing a gold collar round its neck. The toad
was glad there was something uglier than itself; it
frightened the pug dog, and was comforted.</p>

<p>"One day as the little toad was crawling along
it heard steps. 'I shall be killed it said,' and it
tried to hurry away. But the steps came nearer and
nearer. Suddenly the toad felt itself taken up
gently, and it saw bending over it the face of a
young man, and it was a kind face; and the young
man put the little toad down in a sheltered spot,
saying 'Remain there, out of harm's way, till I
come back.' He went away." Here Meg's voice
faltered.</p>

<p>"He did not know that there were dreadful
thorns in that spot; but the little toad tried for
the sake of that friend not to mind. It remained
there, and it was always listening for the young
man's steps coming back. That is all," said Meg
in abrupt conclusion.</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>Then Miss Pinkett said: "What a shocking
story!"</p>

<p>"Shocking!" circled round the table.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Were you the little toad?" asked Laura
Harris.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Meg curtly.</p>

<p>"I like that story," said Ursula, "and I shall
draw such a toad."</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>DRIFTING AWAY.</h3>


<p>It was the eve of the midsummer holidays; the
examinations were over. Miss Pinkett had come
out victorious in music and geography, Ursula in
drawing and artistic needlework. The Beauty had
proved to be nowhere in the competition. Meg
had taken no prize, but she had been encouraged
by kind reports from Signora Vallaria and Mr.
Eyre. She had worked incessantly, and some of
the teachers had recognized her zeal.</p>

<p>The tension of the past few weeks was relaxed,
and Miss Reeves was giving the picnic that she
usually organized for her pupils, in the Surrey
woods, watered by a branch of the Thames. It was
a perfect summer day, broadly golden, benignly
calm.</p>

<p>The repast under the trees was over; the girls,
tired of their games, sat about in groups discussing
plans for the holidays. Meg sat apart. In the
midst of the surrounding gayety the loneliness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
her heart deepened. She was enduring the tantalizing
pangs of picturing the happy hours from
which she was excluded.</p>

<p>She heard of the dear little children who would
come to the station to welcome these home-comers;
of the lawn-tennis parties, the rides, the picnics
which awaited them. One girl was going home
for the wedding of her sister; another was promised
a pony to ride out with her brother George.
There were vivid descriptions going on all around
her of the charms of holidays. Oh, the delights of
not hearing the school-bell of a morning&mdash;of awaking
at the appointed hour, and being able to turn
round cosily for another sleep! All were going
home; even the teachers looked forward to meeting
relatives and friends. She alone was remaining&mdash;she
alone of all the school had no home to go to.
She rose and wandered away. Her desolate little
heart could bear it no more: a bitter sense was
growing there that no one cared for her&mdash;that if
Mr. Standish cared for her he would have written.</p>

<p>Meg walked away, not minding where she went,
willing only to be out of earshot of that joyous talk.
She presently found herself by the river's bank;
and there, moored among the reeds, was the longboat
hired for the occasion, in which the girls had
rowed each other in parties all the morning.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Ursula had pressed her to join the group of which
she was a member, but Meg had refused. It had
seemed to the child enough to lie among the ferns,
inhaling the delicate, pungent perfumes, feeling the
breath of the summer day on her cheek, surrendering
herself to the strength and calm of nature's influence.</p>

<p>Meg now stepped into the boat and sat down. It
was like being in a cradle, she thought, as the
water softly rocked the craft. No one was near.
Presently she perceived that the boat was sliding
off&mdash;softly, softly the shore was receding; the banks
and the long reeds were falling back.</p>

<p>Meg watched immobile. Bundles of oars lay at
the bottom of the boat; which was also strewn
with bunches of meadow-sweet, elder-blossoms,
forget-me-nots, and other riverside trophies which
the girls had plucked on their travels. Meg sat upright
like a startled rabbit, wondering when the
boat would stop. She wished that it would never
stop&mdash;that it would carry her away, away, she
knew not whither! She had heard the girls speak
of the "weir." What was that? Was it some
weird spot?&mdash;a strange island, perhaps, inhabited
by some of the water-fowl of which she had read?</p>

<p>Then she perceived that the boat had swung itself
round; it was drifting down with the current.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
The river was narrow, and there was not another
boat within sight. Without oars, without sails,
without guidance, the little craft was making its
way, keeping right in the middle of the stream.
For a moment Meg could not believe; then joy
seized her&mdash;she was off on her travels!</p>

<p>Past pale-green willows that hung their branches
down into the water, filling it with a twilight of
green, sprinkling its surface with leaves as with a
goblin fleet; past sunny, silent stretches of woodland
and meadows where cows grazed and looked
at her with horny heads sharply outlined against
the light; past banks full of flowers went Meg.
The sun shone for her, the breeze stirred for her,
the trees seemed to look at her. She felt like a
little river-queen.</p>

<p>As she drifted along, the misery and loneliness at
her heart dropped, like the leaves the breeze had
shaken from the willows. She, the despised Meg,
was free; all nature was her playfellow. From the
banks the cuckoo cried like a friendly presence
playing at "hide-and-seek" with her. A kingfisher,
with a breast like a jewel fashioned in the
sky, skimmed past her where the solitude was
shadiest. From the forked branches of a willow a
water hen, sitting on its nest, peered at her with
trustful eyes; a water rat from under the leaf of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
water lily eyed her with pleasant sympathy, as if he
understood the pleasures of a skiff on a summer
day. The fishes leaped and made rippled circles
around her.</p>

<p>After awhile the river broadened. She passed
boathouses that appeared to stand in the water,
their roofs bright with flowers; she drifted along
a bank where children were playing. They left
their games to watch her. They pointed at her,
and Meg lifted herself up that she might be better
seen, feeling more than ever like a little river
queen. She, the wild, despised Meg, was envied
and admired!</p>

<p>Once more the river grew lonely. Presently she
thought she heard a distant, drowsy sound; it grew
louder; the boat seemed to glide along more quickly.
After awhile the sound became a roar, and the boat
skimmed along as if it were flying; still the water
remained smooth as glass. She fancied she heard
voices shouting, but the roar of the water filled her
ears till it became a boom. She sat up straight and
rigid, and as she flashed past she saw with dreadful
clearness the word "Danger" written up in great
letters on a post by the riverside. For the first time
Meg's heart began to beat. She heard shouts; she
turned her head, and again she saw with terrible
distinctness the word "Danger" written above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
place the boat was making for. The water-line
ended there, and she understood the booming was
the roar of the river rushing down to a lower level.
Her boat would upset and she must drown! Meg
shut her eyes. Mr. Standish, the old boarding-house,
seemed to rise before her as she speeded
along.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boat jerked, struggling like a living
creature arrested in full flight.</p>

<p>"Don't move!" shouted a voice; and Meg, quiet
as an image, felt the struggling boat slowly turned
round; a head showed above the water; a muscular
arm, bare to the elbow, a figure clad in white flannels,
swimming low and strong, were beside her.</p>

<p>It had been accomplished in one moment's time.
The boat was being now pushed in the direction of
a bank, on which stood a watching group of young
men, clad, like her rescuer, in white flannels and
loose, bright-colored jackets. One of these got into
the water, and catching the prow of the boat, pulled
it in with one vigorous sweep. The keel grazed the
bottom of the river; the young men lifted Meg and
set her on shore.</p>

<p>"Well, if ever a little girl escaped drowning you
have!" said her rescuer, giving himself a shake.</p>

<p>Meg was silent as she realized that she had been
saved from drowning in the whirl and foam of roar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>ing
water. The young men looked at her with
kind, smiling glances&mdash;she was surrounded with
laughing eyes and gleaming teeth. They plied her
with questions of "Who was she?" "What was her
name?" "Where did she come from?" "Had she
been frightened?"</p>

<p>She explained how she had got into the boat and
she had drifted away. No, she had not been frightened&mdash;only
when she saw the word "Danger" she
had begun to be afraid.</p>

<p>Her rescuers voted that she was a heroine.</p>

<p>The young men moved away a few steps and held
a consultation; one, who had an eyeglass stuck in
his eye and a pipe in his mouth, came forward.</p>

<p>"Get into the boat, Meg, and we will all row you
back. You will point out the place you came from
when we approach it."</p>

<p>He handed Meg in, and the young fellows vied
with each other to pay her attention. One put a
cushion at her back, another a plank to her feet.
"Meg," they vowed, "must be rowed back in
triumph."</p>

<p>They stepped into the boat, four took oars.
Another sat behind Meg, ropes in hand. Presently
they lit their pipes. Meg sat back in state. How
kind they were! They were not cross, as girls
mostly were; they did not mock or tease her; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
did not say a word of what some of the girls called
chaff. She watched with amazement all their pipes
going puff, puff, puff. She liked them because they
did not talk much. They reminded her of Mr. Standish.
When their eyes caught hers they gave
her a smile. How strong they were! She watched
their muscular arms and hands sweeping the water
with their oars, the rhythmic movement of their
swaying bodies.</p>

<p>No Greek maiden delivered from peril by a
group of demi-gods ever felt more lost in dreamy
wonder and gratitude than did Meg, rowed up the
river by her rescuers. Her eyes rested oftenest on
the one who had saved her&mdash;he seemed to her the
most magnificent member of this gallant crew.
He had laughing, twinkling eyes, thick, short, curly
hair, silky mustache no bigger than an eyebrow.
It occurred to her that she had not thanked him for
saving her life. She turned over in her mind what
was the proper thing to say. She tried to recollect
what persons in story-books said to the saviours of
their lives, but she could not remember; she pondered,
but the words of gratitude would not come.
At last she exclaimed abruptly:</p>

<p>"You saved my life&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I am very much
obliged to you."</p>

<p>A peal of laughter taken up by all the group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
greeted this speech. The laughter was so jovial
and good-natured that Meg felt at her ease. It
seemed to say: "What nonsense! Don't thank me.
It was nothing."</p>

<p>Then they began to question her again: "Was
she afraid of meeting her schoolmistress? Would
she be scolded?"</p>

<p>Meg admitted the possibility of being scolded.
Her rescuers vowed that they would plead for her.
They would extract a promise from the schoolmistress
not to punish her. Meg must not be
scolded; Meg must be welcomed home like the
prodigal returning.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed Meg dejectedly, pointing to
a group of girls and teachers looking up and down
the river. She enjoyed the amazement of the spectators
as from the bank they watched her triumphant
return. With a sweep of the oars the boat
came alongside the shore. Miss Reeves stepped
forward.</p>

<p>"You must have been frightened, madam, at this
young lady's disappearance," said Meg's rescuer,
jumping on shore.</p>

<p>Meg allowed herself to be helped out like a
princess by the oarsmen.</p>

<p>"We had not long missed the child," replied
Miss Reeves. "We were startled when we dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>covered
that the boat was gone. She ought not to
have gone alone&mdash;it was very thoughtless."</p>

<p>"The boat drifted away with her&mdash;it nearly
carried her down the weir," said the spokesman.
"She was very courageous."</p>

<p>Meg felt herself pleaded for, and listened,
motionless.</p>

<p>"You saved her life?" said Miss Reeves.</p>

<p>"I was able, by swimming out in time, to turn
the boat's head," replied the young man lightly.
"She behaved with great pluck."</p>

<p>"I am most grateful, and I shall acquaint her
guardians," said Miss Reeves.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;pray don't!" replied the young man;
and his comrades echoed his words. "Only," he
added with a merry twinkle, "do not let Miss Meg
be scolded! She is so spirited, so courageous&mdash;she
ought to have a medal for steadiness of nerves."</p>

<p>Miss Reeves hesitated, then she said smiling:
"She will not be scolded."</p>

<p>The announcement was received with approbation,
the young men shook hands with Meg, and
lifting their white caps to Miss Reeves and the
schoolgirls, turned away.</p>

<p>Meg watched their figures retreating through the
trees; and when they vanished she felt the loneliness
creep over her again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>REBELLION.</h3>


<p>The second week of the holidays had come. For
close upon a fortnight Meg had been alone with
Miss Grantley. The self-centered chilliness of the
English teacher deepened the solitary child's sense
of isolation. Miss Grantley affected her like the
embodied quintessence of censure upon all her
moods and actions.</p>

<p>This lady always made Meg feel in the wrong.
An increased brusqueness of gesture, a more rigid
set of the defiant lips, expressed the protest of the
wild little soul.</p>

<p>During the first week of her holidays she had a
companion in her solitude. It was a battered doll,
with rough hair and faded cheeks. It looked
deserted. Rosamund Seely, a kind-hearted child,
as a parting gift, had offered it to Meg on receiving
the present of a beautiful new doll. "Poor Meg,
you are going to be left alone. There's a dollie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
for you," the child had said, in transferring the
belated toy; and Meg's desolate soul had been
touched by the words.</p>

<p>For a week she had loyally carried the plaything
about with her; she had perched it on a branch of
the yew tree when she sat on her leafy throne; she
had got to feel so lonely that she sometimes talked
to it, and felt toward it as toward a companion, bidding
her answer when she spoke. After awhile
that constant comrade, sitting opposite to her with
its grimy cheeks, its faded and ragged finery, became
in its look of abandonment an emblem to Meg of
herself. She grew to hate the sight of the doll; but
still she would not part with it for the sake of the
donor, and she thrust it in a corner of the shelf
assigned to her in the dormitory.</p>

<p>The loneliness chilled the marrow of the child's
life. The object ever in view, the repellent attitude
toward her comrades, the consciousness that her
replies were waited for and sometimes admired, had
kept up Meg's spirit. It flagged in the length, the
languor, the emptiness of those July days. There
was nothing to be done but to sit up in the tree, to
read, to think, and remember. As the hare
seeks its form, so Meg's thoughts returned to the
home where she had spent her childhood. She was
always seeing that place on the stairs from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
she had watched the coming and going of her only
friend during those neglected years. Why did he
not write to her? Why? Her lonely heart asked
itself this question with insistence. He had promised
to write to her, he was true, he never told a
falsehood. Why did he not write? Then the conviction
was borne in upon her that a letter was
waiting for her at Mrs. Browne's house. Mr.
Standish thought the landlady would forward it,
but perhaps the stern white-haired gentleman, who
told her she must forget her childhood and every
one she had then met, would withhold her address
from Mrs. Browne. The conviction haunted Meg.
If she could but get to London she would make her
way to Mrs. Browne and get that letter. Meg
would lie awake, thinking of this, "If she could but
get to London." The contemplation was still vague
in her mind. It wanted something to condense it
into a resolution, and that something came.</p>

<p>One late afternoon Meg sat at tea with Miss
Grantley. She was always awkward under this
lady's censorious glance. Stretching her hand for
the bread and butter she upset her cup of milk
on the teacher's dress. Miss Grantley had on her
best mauve silk. She was going out to supper with
a friend. As she wiped the stain from her draperies
she looked icily at Meg.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your manners are deplorable, Miss Beecham.
I do not wonder that your companions shun you.
It must be most painful for young ladies to be
associated with one who so richly deserves her
nickname of the 'savage.'"</p>

<p>"I am not a savage," said Meg shortly.</p>

<p>"Do not answer me. Your untamed nature,
which neither religion nor culture has softened, does
not possess the very rudiments of civilized society.
You shame this establishment. I had meant to take
you out this evening."</p>

<p>"I would not have gone," retorted Meg, her eyes
brilliant with indignation.</p>

<p>"Impudent little thing! Don't venture to talk
to me like that!" and forgetting herself, Miss
Grantley rose and gave a slap with the back of her
hand on Meg's ear.</p>

<p>A fit of fury seized the child. She was once
more the old wild Meg. She rushed into the garden,
running blindly she knew not whither. A couple
of slugs were crawling across her path. With an
impulse of revenge she picked them up, and hurrying
to Miss Grantley's room, hid them in the
bonnet that lay on the bed ready to be put on.</p>

<p>From the dormitory Meg listened. She heard
Miss Grantley go in, and when two short shrieks
reached her ear she shook with impish laughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
The next moment Miss Grantley appeared on the
threshold.</p>

<p>"I know you did this," she said.</p>

<p>"I did," replied Meg.</p>

<p>"You might have given me my death. I might
have had a fit. Miss Reeves comes home to-morrow,
and the first thing I will do on her return is to
report you to her. Meanwhile, you shall not leave
this room."</p>

<p>Miss Grantley left, and Meg heard the key turn
in the lock.</p>

<p>She was locked in.</p>

<p>A rush of passion swept over Meg as she realized
that she was a captive. For a moment she stood
stock still, thinking of all the terrible things Miss
Grantley had said, realizing the bankruptcy of her
little peace. She saw herself brought up solemnly
before Miss Reeves, who appeared to her to live
against a kind of ethereal background. A touch
of fear chilled her courageous spirit. The silence
of the school, the empty dormitory, deepened the
impression of reprobation cast upon her. She felt
herself disowned by a law-abiding community.
Suddenly an idea came which held her breath in
suspense&mdash;she would run away! She would go to
London. There was a finger post on the highroad
they sometimes passed in their walk which pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to London. She would get out and follow that
road, and make her way to Mrs. Browne. The
immensity of the resolve overcame Meg for a
moment. She walked restlessly up and down the
room. Then, with shaking hands, she began to
pack up her treasures. A spasm of excitement held
her lips rigid as she set about collecting what she
would take with her.</p>

<p>Goldsmith's "Animated Nature," the "Stories
from the History of England," and "Cinderella,"
would go into one parcel with the little writing-case.
She had still the brown paper and the bit
of cord that had held them at her coming. The
silver pencil-case and the roll of articles she resolved
to carry inside the bodice of her dress. The single
threepenny-piece with a hole through it which she
possessed, a present from Mrs. Browne, she put
into her pocket to serve in case of emergencies.</p>

<p>She would take nothing more with her.</p>

<p>As Meg was tying up her books she caught sight
of the doll, with its demoralized, abandoned air,
seeming to be watching her. With a movement of
sudden, unaccountable anger she took it up and
threw it to the furthest corner of the room.</p>

<p>Her preparations made, Meg began to turn over
in her mind means of escape. She set about calculating
the chances like a little general. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
looked out of the window. The door being locked,
this was her single means of exit. The porch stood
right under the center dormitory window, the wall
stretched sheer and blank between.</p>

<p>Meg was gazing down with neck craned to discover
if the wall contained any chinks or irregularities
that might serve as stepping-stones, when the
door opened, and Rachel the housemaid entered,
bringing Meg's supper on a tray.</p>

<p>Meg perceived that besides a liberal amount of
bread and butter there was a large slice of currant
cake.</p>

<p>Rachel was a conscientious and sullen young
woman, who executed orders and delivered messages
with the exactitude of a sundial and the
surliness of a bulldog. She laid the tray sternly
down.</p>

<p>"Cook sends her duty, miss, and this bit of cake
which she made for the kitchen. She hopes you'll
accept it."</p>

<p>"Thank cook kindly, and say I am much obliged,"
replied Meg with alacrity, recognizing the value of
this contribution to her commissariat. The offering
appeared to her in the light of a good omen.</p>

<p>Rachel received Meg's thanks in gruff silence,
and departed, deliberately locking the door behind
her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Meg drank the tumbler of milk, but abstained
from touching the provisions. She took a page of
newspaper lining one of the drawers and carefully
packed the cake and bread and butter, fastening
this smaller parcel to the larger one of books.</p>

<p>Then again she returned to her meditations and
calculations as to her mode of escape. If she had
but a stout rope with which to swing herself
down!</p>

<p>Then suddenly she remembered stories of hairbreadth
escapes from fires, recounted to her by Mr.
Standish, effected by the aid of a ladder made of
sheets and blankets knotted together.</p>

<p>The materials were at hand with which to attain
her freedom. Meg's mind was made up. As soon
as she was safe from interruption: when Miss
Grantley had returned and the household had retired
to rest, she would begin making a ladder of
sheets.</p>

<p>She determined not to go to bed, but to sit up till
daybreak, and at the first streak of dawn scale the
wall and escape.</p>

<p>Then she remembered that it would be probable
that Miss Grantley would conform to the habit of
the school, and make her round over the various
rooms. At this thought Meg swiftly set about obliterating
every trace of disorder from the dormitory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
She stowed her parcel out of sight, and drew the
curtains, and began to undress.</p>

<p>She was not yet in bed when she heard steps
coming up the garden path and voices bidding each
other good-night.</p>

<p>A few moments later the key of her door was
turned, a step entered, and Meg heard the rustle of
a silk dress. Miss Grantley was making her rounds.
Meg appeared to be profoundly asleep; she was
conscious of candle-light directed upon her face, but
her eyelids did not quiver.</p>

<p>Miss Grantley stole out of the dormitory. Meg
listened for the click of the key turned again upon
her, but this time Miss Grantley contented herself
with closing the door.</p>

<p>Meg could not believe her ears. She got out of
bed, and by the moonlight she examined the lock.
No, the second bolt was not drawn; the key
was not turned. There was no necessity to make a
ladder of bedclothes, no need to have recourse to
this perilous mode of escape. This difficulty removed
seemed like another good omen, an assurance of
success to Meg.</p>

<p>She felt as if some guardian angel child were directing
her project.</p>

<p>Before returning to bed, and when by the perfect
silence she judged that all the household was asleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
she softly drew back the curtains from the windows.
Then she lay down, determined to keep awake.</p>

<p>She would not go to sleep; she struggled to keep
slumber at bay. She sat up when she felt drowsiness
overtake her; unconsciously she slipped off
into a doze. She had a dream, rather the sketch of
a dream. She had a glimpse of a road&mdash;she was
walking. She started up frightened, got out of bed,
rubbed her eyes, plunged her face into water; she
was wide awake now. Then she lay down again;
unaware she dropped asleep.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>AWAY.</h3>


<p>The day had shot a golden arrow across the uncurtained
window of the dormitory when Meg
awoke. The sense of something to be done confusedly
urged itself upon her mind, and she jumped
out of bed. In a flash she remembered everything,
and with trembling trepidation she asked herself
was she late? Were the servants stirring? The
profound silence in the house reassured her. Outside
she saw the sky saffron and rose behind the
trees, and she heard the birds singing their matins.
Meg began to dress rapidly. She was careful in
her speed. She was going on a long journey on
foot, and she must not look like a little tramp.</p>

<p>Having completed her toilette she took up her
parcel and softly opened the door. Her nerves
were tense with excitement, and a restrained trembling
shook her from head to foot. How still it
was! She had a strange fancy; the silence seemed
as though some unseen presence was there listening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and watching. The shutters were closed everywhere;
only a gleam of light flickered through the
skylight on the lobby. If she stumbled she would
wake some of the inmates; she kept thinking as she
stole down. Once she nearly lost her footing. She
fancied she had come to the last step of a flight of
stairs when two or three still remained to descend.
Had she not caught herself up in time she would
have fallen, and, weighted as she was, the clatter
would have been heard through the house.</p>

<p>As she crossed the hall she knocked up against
something which fell with a muffled sound, that in
the gulf of silence came like a boom. Meg listened.
She heard the furtive clicking of a door above. She
waited motionless. It was succeeded by no sound
of footsteps, and she concluded it was the creaking
of an unclosed door. Then she resumed her progress.
She groped her way down to the kitchen&mdash;she
knew there was no possibility of letting herself
out by the hall door&mdash;it was dark there, and she
knocked her foot against a chair and hurt herself.
But she did not mind the pain. All her capabilities
of feeling were strained in listening. Had she been
heard? The silence still lay like a spell over the
house. She shut the door that isolated the downstairs
premises and she felt safer.</p>

<p>All depended still upon the caution of her move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>ments,
as she turned the key and unbarred the bolts
of the door of the servants' exit. With determined
quiet the deft brown hands proceeded upon their
task when another danger met Meg. Pilot began
to bark outside. His kennel was close to the kitchen
door, and the furtive sounds had caught his ear and
roused his suspicions. Every bark grew louder, and
he growled savagely. Meg controlled the trembling
that seized her, and the next movement opened the
door and encountered the dog. Pilot was reputed
dangerous by the schoolgirls, but Meg had no fear.
In her isolation she had made friends with the mastiff.
At sight of the little figure with hand uplifted
to enjoin silence, Pilot paused in the spring he was
crouching to make, and stopped barking.</p>

<p>"Hush, Pilot," whispered Meg in a concentrated
voice; "don't bark, not on any account, Pilot! I
am running away because I am miserable. Good-by,
old Pilot!"</p>

<p>Pilot looked at Meg with questioning eyes, debating
the reasonableness of her speech. He
apparently hesitated to commend the step she was
taking, for he did not return her greeting with any
demonstration, but remained with head erect and
pricked ears surveying her, and let her go in
silence.</p>

<p>Meg went round to the kitchen-garden. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
decided to escape that way. The wall was covered
with a trellis-work on which fruit was trained.
Meg threw her parcel lightly over and began to
clamber. She heard the unripe plums fall as she
climbed with a sure-footedness that was one of her
claims to the title of "savage" bestowed upon her
by her schoolmates. With the agility of a squirrel
she swung herself over and dropped among the
nettles that grew at the base of the wall.</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet, picked up her parcel, conscious
of one dominant emotion only&mdash;she was out
of Moorhouse; she was free! Like a bird winging
its way to more genial climes Meg dashed forward.</p>

<p>Across two fields at the back of the house, the
bright road lay before her; her escape was made.
Not a soul was up, and forgetting that she should
economize her strength she ran gladly along, when
suddenly an object arrested her eyes and riveted
her to the spot. There, at the stile, facing the field,
the path through which issued on to the highroad,
stood a figure. The face was turned away, but
Meg recognized that straight back, that dark dress
with austere folds, that severe straw bonnet. It
was Miss Grantley.</p>

<p>Was it some waking nightmare, an illusion of
frightened fancy? Meg remembered the furtive
click of the door. Could her escape have been dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>covered,
and the mistress be lying in wait for her?
With desperate resolve, after a moment, Meg determined
to chance it. She would creep beside the
hedge that led round the stile, and once on the
other side she would trust to fortune and to her
heels to escape pursuit. She began softly to move;
a spray of woodbine caught her skirt&mdash;she disentangled
it with trembling fingers; a puddle barred
the way; she prepared to leap over it, watching
that figure with terror. Something in its stillness,
its stiffness, and its bent head frightened her. She
thought she would call out and speak to it. As she
hesitated the figure turned round, and Meg saw, not
Miss Grantley, but a stranger whom she had seen at
church and admired for her young and peaceful
countenance. The lady was holding carefully
something lying in her hollowed hand. Perceiving
Meg she beckoned. The coil of fear about Meg's
heart loosened, and she breathed again.</p>

<p>"Look at this poor chick!" said the stranger.
"It has dropped from the nest. See how the
mother is hovering round. Poor mother, we will
not hurt your little one. God takes care of the
fallen nestlings."</p>

<p>"Shall I put it back into the nest?" said Meg
impulsively, feeling generous under the impression
of that great relief.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can you climb?" said the stranger.</p>

<p>For answer Meg deposited her parcel and climbed
up into the tree, then stretching out her hand she
took the little bird tenderly, and in a moment she
had softly dropped it back into the nest.</p>

<p>"That was a good action," said the lady, as she
came down again, looking kindly at her. "I thought
I was the only one out of doors&mdash;it is not yet five
o'clock; but you have taken the conceit out of me.
This is holiday time. Is that the way you take
your holidays, by going out to walk at sunrise?"</p>

<p>Meg nodded. She was eager to dismiss the
stranger; but still the lady dallied, looking kindly
at her.</p>

<p>"There is a little nosegay; I picked it as I went
out. I give it to you. Good-by!"</p>

<p>She took some flowers from her belt.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Meg, with cordiality.</p>

<p>The stranger nodded again, and turning round
walked away with swift and even steps.</p>

<p>Meg loitered a moment watching her, then she
clambered over the stile and was off.</p>

<p>She sped along until she reached the highroad.
She turned Londonward, not slackening her pace.
Not a living soul was within sight or hearing. She
had the road to herself. The sun was behind her.
Her shadow stretched thin and long before her. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
looked like her own ghost gliding in front of her
and leading her on. Meg did not look about her,
but she was conscious of a universal shining around
her, of jocund shadows about her feet, of birds
twittering, and delicate perfumes stirring through
the breeze that blew so pure and fresh that it seemed
to come from heaven's gate. She ran until she
could run no more, then skirting the fields she
walked quickly along. She thought it was another
good omen that the day of her flight should be
so brave and gladsome. Was nature rejoicing with
her because she was hurrying to the place where
she would hear news of the only friend she had in
the world?</p>

<p>The hedges sparkled with dew; every bush and
brake was hung with sheeny fragments of hoary
silver that turned to gold in the sunlight. For her
every blade of grass and little flower glistened with
a limpid coronal. A thrush sang aloft in a tree;
Meg thought it sang for her. After awhile she
met a few laborers, but they took no notice of her.
Their eyes were fixed on the ground.</p>

<p>As Meg walked along the assurance that a letter
was awaiting her grew in intensity. She had
heard that by steady walking London could be
reached in six hours, seven at most. It was not
five o'clock when she started. She would be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
London by noon. She saw herself already entering
the big city, asking her way to Queen Street; she
would make straight for number 22 and ring the
bell. Perhaps a strange servant would answer
it; perhaps it would be Mrs. Browne herself.
What a surprise, what exclamations, if it were the
landlady who answered the door! But she would
not reply to any questions until she had got her
letter. "What letter?" "The letter that came for
me with a foreign stamp," she would answer. "Ah,
yes! it had come. How had she known it had
come? There it was;" and she would take it to
her attic, and sitting by the window she would read
and read it till she knew every word of it by heart.</p>

<p>Meg passed a village. The people were astir in
the streets, the shops were open. Everything
sparkled in the sunshine and cast a blue shadow.
A baby was crawling on all-fours, its little blue
shadow by its side. A woman in the doorway with
bare arms akimbo was chatting to a friend. Some
geese were waddling down, moving spots of incomparable
whiteness. A cart full of hay was standing
in the glare of that morning sun. A red-armed
girl was milking a patient cow, and there came
the pleasant sound of the milk as it rushed into the
pail. It was half-past eight by the church clock,
the face of which was a blob of brightness. Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Grantley and the servants had discovered her flight
by this time. Perhaps they guessed that she was
going toward London; perhaps that strange lady
would tell! Meg at this thought left the road for
the fields, and walked on the other side of the
hedge. She tried to walk quicker to avoid pursuit;
but all at once she began to feel as if she could not
take another step. She was so tired. She was
weak also from hunger. She must sit down and
eat.</p>

<p>She had entered a meadow bordered at the further
end by a stream. She crossed the grassy stretch,
took off her shoes and stockings, and waded ankle-deep
into the water. On the other side a little
wood cast its shade. She would sit and take her
pleasant rest there. The touch of the cool running
water was delightful to her burning feet. She
knelt on the opposite bank and bathed her hands
and face. Then she sat down under a tree. It was
delicious to rest; it was enough for a moment to
feel how tired she was, to lean back and enjoy the
support of that great trunk, and the shade of those
leafy branches. No queen ever sat on a throne
more restful, nor under a more dainty canopy. She
took out the bread and butter&mdash;she would not touch
the cake yet&mdash;and began to eat. She ate slowly.
Her repast was a banquet. It tasted of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
penetrating sweet perfumes about her; of the
honey-laden breeze, of the fruity sunshine.</p>

<p>When it was over Meg thought it would be
pleasant to lie down and sleep. Then she rebuked
herself. She had no time for sleep, she must get
on to London. She had no time to waste; still
she dallied. Nature had spread a couch of dried
aromatic leaves for her, perfumed with sweet small
flowers, guarded by a green barrier of bushes,
shaded with a curtain of leaves. The soothing
stillness of nature crooned to her a wordless lullaby.
Meg stretched herself under the tree, drowsiness
overcame her. She thought of the little bird that
had fallen from its nest. Was she like that little
bird which had dropped from its home of twigs?
But she said to herself, "I put it back there."</p>

<p>Meg had a dream. The black slug had grown
to an immense size, with its horns out. Its face
seemed to grow like Miss Grantley's. Then it
seemed to her that hostile inimical presences were
around her, muttering. She woke; where was she?
Who were around her? Brown eyes gazed down
upon her from every side, warm breathings passed
across her face, wide pink nostrils inquisitively
moved up and down.</p>

<p>A forest of light-tipped horns surrounded her.</p>

<p>Meg started up. At the sudden movement the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
creatures jerked backward and took flight. She
heard the clatter of hoofs; then pausing and
huddling together, they turned and looked at her
from a distance. Meg gazed back at them. She
laughed; these woodland gossips were heifers&mdash;five
heifers. She called to them, but they would not
come. When she got up to approach them they
scampered off.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>AN ACQUAINTANCE BY THE WAY.</h3>


<p>Meg decided that time for luncheon had come.
The shadows lay long beside the trees and marked
afternoon. She felt so rested as she blithely ate
the piece of plum-cake saved from last night's
supper that it seemed to her that she could walk all
the way. It was a generous slice, and she threw
crumbs for the birds, which flew down from the
surrounding wood and became her guests.</p>

<p>Meg would have gladly dallied awhile, but time
was pressing. She must get to London to-night.
Taking off her shoes and stockings once more she
crossed the stream, pausing a moment to enjoy the
sense of the running water against her bare ankles.
Then she determinedly resumed shoes and stockings,
and after bathing her hands and face she
turned to go on her way.</p>

<p>The road lay through hedges full of sweet-smelling
eglantine and wild rose which stirred with
every gust. As Meg trudged along she looked at
the marks in the sand left by the feet which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
come and gone across it that day. They made a
confused pattern, through which here and there a
footprint came out distinctly. There was one of
a big nailed shoe that recurred with a sort of plodding
regularity, and there was another of a dainty
high-heeled boot that seemed to speed gayly along.
There was a clumsy sprawling mark of a woman's
foot that suggested slatternly shodding, and by its
side that of a child's naked foot. Meg wondered if
these were a mother and child, beggars going up to
London. Presently another footmark attracted her
attention. It was that of a single nailed boot,
attended by what looked like the mark of one toe
resting on the ground, surmounted by another mark.
Together these two prints seemed to make a sign of
admiration in the sand. Meg puzzled over this
strange footmark till she forgot all the others. It
fascinated her; preceding her like a cheery mystery.
After a while the trace vanished. Meg watched for
it; but it had gone, and with it the road seemed to
her to have lost some of its interest. Presently she
was startled by a "thump, thump" behind her. She
felt a little startled, and she turned round to see
who was coming. It was a lad swinging himself
actively along on a high crutch. He soon overtook
Meg, and as he passed he gave her a sidelong
glance and touched his hat. He had a pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
plain face, and bright brown eyes. She noticed
that as he went along he left on the road that
double mark that had such a quaint resemblance
to a point of admiration.</p>

<p>Meg had returned his salute with a nod, which
was not wanting in cordiality although it was somewhat
stiff. This cripple seemed to her an acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Nice day, miss!" said the boy.</p>

<p>Meg nodded again.</p>

<p>"Going this way, miss?" continued the cripple.</p>

<p>"Yes," Meg replied, in a tone of embarrassed
coolness, which was not, however, discouraging to
conversation.</p>

<p>"Going far, miss?"</p>

<p>"Going to London," said Meg.</p>

<p>The cripple looked at her with evident admiration.</p>

<p>"Are you going to London?" asked Meg.</p>

<p>"No," replied the lad, "I'm going part of the
way."</p>

<p>Meg did not like to press the question further,
and the resources of conversation seemed exhausted.</p>

<p>"You see," said the boy after a pause, "I'm
going to earn my livin' and the livin' of my mither
and the little chap."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Meg looked at her companion with some surprise.</p>

<p>"I'm agoing to where I can earn thirteen pence
a day; there's where I'm going. What I want is,
they may want for nothink off there," and the boy,
with a jerk of his chin, indicated a backward direction.</p>

<p>Meg felt curious to know how this crippled boy
earned a living, but she did not like to inquire. So
she said, with vague encouragement to further confidence,
"You love them very much?"</p>

<p>"I love 'em," assented the cripple in a guarded
tone. After a pause he continued, with more frankness,
"I'm uncommon fond of the little chap.
Mither can't earn enough, so he depends upon me,
like. Now, how old do you think I am?" He
straightened himself for her inspection, and leaned
upon his crutch with the air of a soldier on parade.</p>

<p>Meg hesitated. The boy had a quaint, plucky
face, childlike in line, and yet old by its expression
of sagacity and caution. His arms and hands were
well developed; one shriveled leg hung helpless at
some distance from the ground. He seemed of no
age and no distinct size.</p>

<p>"I cannot guess," said Meg. "I am eleven and
a half," she added, with a generosity of confidence
that invited a magnanimous return.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am fourteen come next March," said the boy.
"Now you think I can't do nothink because of that
ere leg." He glanced with some contempt down
the maimed limb. "You thinks because I can't put
my foot on the ground I can't do nothink. I can
do everythink." The cripple turned with a swagger,
and the children resumed their walk.</p>

<p>"I once punched a lad&mdash;he was older than me&mdash;who
was worriting the little chap."</p>

<p>"You did?" said Meg admiringly.</p>

<p>"I did. He was striking the little chap in the
face; and I comes upon him, and with my fist I
gives him a blow, and before he can look up I hits
him another, and when he knocks my crutch down
I fastens upon him&mdash;I drags him down, that's what
I does."</p>

<p>"You did right!" cried Meg.</p>

<p>"And I just gives it to him till he lies quiet as a
lamb. And says I to him, 'If ye do it again I'll
serves ye the likes again,' that what I says," concluded
the cripple, marching along with a triumphant
"thump, thump," of his crutch.</p>

<p>"I am glad you did it," said Meg, with a flush
on her cheek and approval in her eye.</p>

<p>"That's what I does," repeated the cripple, with
another swagger of his pendant body.</p>

<p>Meg began to feel a great respect for this cripple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
who seemed to her to have the spirit of a lion.</p>

<p>"How are you going to earn money?" she asked,
feeling an admiring friendship now justified the
question.</p>

<p>The cripple, after a cautious moment, replied:</p>

<p>"Blacking boots."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Meg, a little disconcerted.</p>

<p>"Faither was a dustman. I'd raither be a dustman
than anythink. Ye've a cart, and there ye
sits, and ye comes down only to clean away the
rubbish; and sometimes ye find an elegant teaspoon,
and ye may find a ring. Faither once found a gold
ring with three red stones in it that shine. There's
nothink like being a dustman," said the boy, with
an air of one taking a survey of all the learned professions.
"I'd be a dustman, but because of that
ere leg. To be a dustman you must be hale in all
yer limbs, ye must; so a lady comes round and says
I'm to be a bootblack. She gives me brushes and a
board and a pot of blacking, and I sets to; and I
can make boots shine as will make your eyes blink.
Now your boots," with a downward glance at Meg's
feet, "are uncommon dusty&mdash;I'll black 'em for you."</p>

<p>Meg hesitated; but the cripple had already unstrapped
the parcel swung on his back, taken from
it a brush, a pot of blacking, and a board, and was
down on one knee before her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Meg could not refuse. She placed first one foot
then the other on the board, and brush, brush went
the active hands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a big struggle was going on within
Meg. She had no money but that threepenny-piece.
Ought she to give it to the lad for blacking her
boots? She put her hand into her pocket and turned
the small silver piece about.</p>

<p>It was all that stood between her and penury.
Still she could not accept a service without paying
for it from this cripple, who was earning money for
the "little chap."</p>

<p>"There!" said the boy rising, putting up his traps
with an air of fine indifference to the effect produced
by his action upon Meg's boots.</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged," said Meg hesitatingly;
"and here is threepence."</p>

<p>"I don't want yer money," replied the boy with
an emphatic jerk of his head. "Keep it; ye'll
want it yerself."</p>

<p>Meg's admiration for her companion increased.
She gazed down on her boots. "They're splendid,"
she said fervently; "I never thought boots could
shine like that!"</p>

<p>"Well, I thinks as no one can beat me at blacking,"
said the cripple, accepting the compliment.
"It's my notions as when the sloppy weather comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
I'll make two shillings a day. But it's not a bootblack
I'll remain."</p>

<p>"What will you become?" asked Meg.</p>

<p>"I do not mind telling you," replied the cripple
with cautious slowness. "I'm going to be a joiner.
Ye thinks as I can't. Ye thinks there's too much
agin me. Why, everythink was agin me earning
money. First that school-board, that was agin me.
It wanted to set me all astray, spending time learning
figures and spellin'; but I conquered the school-board.
I gets too old for that after a bit. Then
when I'm told by the lady of this situation in Weybridge
to black boots every morning, there's fifty
miles for me to get over; and here's the cripple
boy agin, two miles from Weybridge!"</p>

<p>The lad gave a chuckle, a jerk of his head, and a
thump of his crutch.</p>

<p>"You've walked fifty miles!" said Meg, with the
homage of round-eyed surprise.</p>

<p>"Fifty miles," repeated the boy. "Then a friend
o' mine is a carpenter. He would not trust me with
a tool two years agone; and now I can plane and
drive nails with the best of them. I had no money
to buy a box of tools. I'm going to work for it
with the boots. All I wants is the sloppy weather,
and a spell of it, and that's enough for me."</p>

<p>Meg's admiration overflowed her pent-up heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and moved her to confide in this cripple and ask
his advice. She had not spoken to him of her
schoolfellows, or of the object that had impelled
her flight.</p>

<p>"Suppose," she began, "some one had been very
kind to you, very good, would you not run away
from people who were unkind to you, and laughed
at you, and despised you?"</p>

<p>"No, I would stay to conquer them," said the
cripple, stamping his crutch.</p>

<p>"How would you conquer them?" said Meg.</p>

<p>"I'd wear 'em out," said the lad. "Spite can't
stand pluck; that's what I've found out. I'd give
'em a laugh, and if they pushed me hard I'd give
'em a slip of my crutch."</p>

<p>Meg was silent awhile with appreciation of such
courage. Then she said:</p>

<p>"But suppose you felt sure there was a letter
waiting for you, would you not go to get it?"</p>

<p>"Depends upon that ere letter," replied the
cripple with circumspection. "If it was to tell me
what to do to better myself I'd go and fetch it were
it at the other end of the country."</p>

<p>"But," said Meg, with a quivering voice, letting
out the secret fear at her heart, "suppose there was
no letter waiting for you when you got to the place?"</p>

<p>"I'd go and look for the one as should ha' writ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>ten
it everywhere. I'd not give over till I found
him," said the cripple.</p>

<p>"You would!" said Meg.</p>

<p>"I would!" repeated the boy.</p>

<p>"I wish you were going all the way to London,"
said Meg.</p>

<p>"To take care of you?" asked the lad. "Wish I
could, but I can't, miss. I have the kid and the
mistress to think of. It's not so far; to-morrow
you'll get there."</p>

<p>"To-morrow!" repeated Meg, aghast.</p>

<p>"It's getting late," said the boy, "ye can't walk
in the night. Now, what I say is, if ye find a barn,
creep in there and lie in the straw; but if ye can
get a hayrick and cover yerself all up to yer
head, that's fit for a king&mdash;better than a bed. I've
slept in 'em, so I ought to know."</p>

<p>Meg could not speak from consternation; the
prospect for a moment overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps ye'll meet a cart, and the driver will
give ye a lift. My faither once gave a lift in his
cart to a little girl going toward London," the
cripple suggested.</p>

<p>"I wish I could meet some one who would drive
me," said Meg in faltering accents.</p>

<p>"If ye're frightened ye'll never find the person
as was good to you," the lad replied rousingly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were not frightened at night, all alone?"
asked Meg.</p>

<p>"I'm frightened of nothink," said the lad; "but
ye're a little lady, so that makes a difference."</p>

<p>Meg asked herself if her companion's shriveled
leg did not make up for the disadvantages of sex,
and she trudged along, resolved not to give in, but
she wished she did not begin to feel so hungry
again.</p>

<p>Presently they came to a fingerpost.</p>

<p>"What's written up there?" said the cripple.</p>

<p>"Can't you see?" asked Meg, astonished.</p>

<p>"I can't read," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Meg, whose admiration received
a great shock.</p>

<p>"I'm ignorant," replied the boy, no whit disconcerted.
"I'll conquer that, too. I conquered that
school-board because I wanted to earn. I'll conquer
ignorance; it's as bad as the school-board."</p>

<p>Meg's admiration revived.</p>

<p>"Weybridge is written on that side," she said.</p>

<p>"That's my way, then," said the cripple. "Good-by
to ye, miss. I hope ye'll get all right. Don't
forget the barn, or the hayrick if ye can get one."</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Meg, wishing to shake hands,
yet hesitating.</p>

<p>The boy touched his hat and set off on his way.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>THE OLD GENTLEMAN AGAIN.</h3>


<p>Meg listened to the thump, thump of the little
crutch going off into the dusk, and to the sound of
merry whistling, and she turned to pursue her way.
The thought of that small lad with his crooked leg
and his great courage roused her spirit. No obstacle
now appeared too great to overcome, no road too
long to walk in order to achieve her object; and she
trudged bravely along.</p>

<p>She was very hungry. Her feet were beginning
to ache again; but she was not going to stop yet;
nothing would induce her to do this; so long as she
could hold out she would walk. She would then
look out for a proper resting-place in which to spend
the night, and set off on her journey in the early
morning. She tried to distract her mind by weighing
the merits of sleeping up in a tree, or down on
the ground, or in a haystack; but her thoughts
would fix themselves upon nothing but upon something
to eat and drink. She passed a village where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
all the cottagers seemed to be at their supper. Meg
trudged valorously along, neither looking to right
or left. Still she debated whether the time had
come for breaking into that threepenny-piece. She
looked at the matter all round. It stood between
her and starvation. Until she reached Mrs. Browne's
house she had nothing else to count upon.</p>

<p>Was she hungry enough yet? Had supper-time
come? A whiff of the perfume of buns and hot
loaves from a wayside shop decided the question.
She felt weak and limp from longing for food, and
she went in. There were tumblers of milk on the
counter. A halfpennyworth of milk and a pennyworth
of bread must make up her meal. The
remaining penny and halfpenny must be left to pay
for her breakfast to-morrow. She drank the milk
in the shop, and she ate the bread in the open air,
sitting on a common outside the village among great
ferns. Meg thought she had never tasted bread so
delicious as this. She felt as if she would like to
sleep here among the crisp ferns; but she got
up, resolved to walk all the way to London if the
daylight would but last.</p>

<p>The fingerpost pointed down a road bordered on
either side by pine trees. It ran through a wood.
The west glowed before her, and the trees marshaled
darkly against the light. The birds flew twittering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
across the sky, and all the insects seemed to be singing
good-night to the day. The straight road
seemed to stretch like a white ribbon before Meg.
It was very lonely. She did not like the solitude;
but she would not admit to herself that she was
frightened. Yet an awe was creeping over her.
The trees seemed supremely dignified. She felt
very small and insignificant as she walked under
their silence.</p>

<p>After awhile she heard a sound. It was a distant
rumble. She looked round. A cart was coming
along. It was filled with hay. Meg thought how
pleasant it would be to creep within, tuck herself
inside the hay, and sleep while the plodding horse
bore her on to her destination. She loitered and
waited until the cart passed, and then went right
out into the road; but at the sight of the large,
red-faced man, whose chin was resting on his chest
and whose eyes were closed, Meg went quickly
back into the path. The rumble of the cart died
away, and again nothing was heard but the twitter
of birds and the drone of the insects. Presently
she heard a voice spreading in song through the
dusk. It sang loud and discordantly. In Meg's
childish experiences songs sung in such tones had
a place; she gave a fierce little shiver, and hid
behind the trees. She was naturally fearless; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
she remained quiet as a little ghost until the figure,
with unsteady gait, had passed. Then Meg resumed
her way determinedly.</p>

<p>All at once she began to realize how tired she
was. It seemed as if she had lost all her strength.
She must lie down. In the faint light and silence,
amid the calm trees, she must lie down and rest.</p>

<p>How quiet and still it was, as if all nature were
bidding Meg trust to its protection and sleep till
morning.</p>

<p>She looked around. There were no hayricks, but
there were clumps of fern and soft sand covered
thickly with the brown needles of pine. Then again
Meg thought she heard the rumble of wheels,
distant like wheels heard in a dream, not jolting
wheels, but soft swift-rolling wheels. A carriage
drawn by two horses was driving down the road
toward London. Meg dreamily remembered how
once she had driven in just such a beautiful carriage
by Mr. Fullbloom's side; how easily they had
traveled. In her weariness came a longing to be
taken up into this carriage and to be driven along.
She stood looking in its direction. It came nearer.
It was an open carriage; a man was sitting inside
it alone. She discerned the gleam of white hair
on which the western light fell. Then she became
aware of a stern face thrust forward, looking out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
at her. She had seen that face before. Where
had she seen it? She dreamily remembered. It
was that of the old gentleman who had bidden her
never mention her childhood.</p>

<p>At a word from him the carriage stopped, and
he beckoned to Meg. She hesitated to come forward;
she felt inclined to run away. There was
a vague motive in that impulse of flight. It partook
of all the past alarm and misery, and she felt very
much as if she stood on the brink of a precipice.
The old gentleman beckoned again impatiently,
and a grotesque idea flitted through Meg's mind
that she must have lain under that tree, gone to
sleep, and had a dream. The carriage, the horses,
the servants, the dreaded old gentleman, were all
a vision that would pass if she made an effort.
She shut her eyes. When she opened them there
was the figure still bending forward.</p>

<p>It beckoned to her. "Come here!" said a voice;
but Meg did not move.</p>

<p>"Drive on!" exclaimed the impatient voice, and
the carriage moved off.</p>

<p>A sudden revulsion of terror seized Meg as she
watched it driving away. She roused herself and
began to run.</p>

<p>Again the figure stooped forward&mdash;beckoned to
her as the carriage stopped.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Meg approached.</p>

<p>"Are you not Meg&mdash;Meg Beecham?" the old
gentleman said in a voice of stern surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Meg answered faintly. There was a
pause; the cold blue eyes rested heavily upon her
as they had done that day, and their gaze suggested
dislike.</p>

<p>"Come inside. I do not hear you," her interlocutor
said, opening the carriage door. He did not
stretch his hand out to help her; and Meg scrambled
up, and at his bidding sat down on the seat opposite.</p>

<p>"Why are you here at this hour and alone? Why
is your dress and your whole appearance so soiled
and tattered? Have you strayed from your teachers?
Have you lost your way?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered Meg.</p>

<p>"No, what?" repeated the old gentleman. "I
do not understand your answer."</p>

<p>"I have not lost my way," said Meg.</p>

<p>"Then where are the persons in whose charge
you are? Where are your schoolfellows?"</p>

<p>"They are not here. I did not go out with
them," said Meg, and paused again.</p>

<p>Her dauntlessness was quelled by fatigue, and by
the chill weight of these eyes fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"Will you answer me plainly? Why are you
here, and why are you alone?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have run away," said Meg with a flicker of
her old spirit.</p>

<p>"Run away from school?" asked the old gentleman
in an icy voice.</p>

<p>Meg nodded.</p>

<p>There was an awful pause.</p>

<p>"Why have you run away?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Meg, "they despise me&mdash;they
say I shame the school. That's why I've run
away."</p>

<p>"You say you have not lost your way," replied
the old gentleman, taking no heed of her answer.
"Where were you going to?"</p>

<p>"To London."</p>

<p>"To London!" repeated her interlocutor. "What
would you have done there?"</p>

<p>"I would have gone to Mrs. Browne. I would
have asked my way until I found her house."</p>

<p>There came a pause, during which the old gentleman
looked at her and muttered himself.</p>

<p>Meg thought she heard him say, "Like parent,
like child. The same evil disposition." Then
lifting his voice, he called to the coachman, "Drive
to Greyling; when you get there ask the way to
Moorhouse, Miss Reeves' school for young ladies."</p>

<p>"No, no! I will not go back!&mdash;I will not!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
cried Meg, jumping to her feet as the carriage began
to turn round.</p>

<p>"You shall go back," said the old gentleman,
pushing her down in the seat opposite and holding
her there.</p>

<p>The carriage moved swiftly, and so noiselessly
that Meg heard every word her companion said.</p>

<p>"You shall go back this time; but if ever you
seek to run away from that school again, no one
will take you back again. You shall be left to
achieve your own willful ruin. I will wash my
hands of you forever.</p>

<p>"Listen," he continued, with upraised finger, as
Meg, awed by his manner, did not reply. "Do
you know what will happen if you try to escape
from that school again? You will become a pauper.
You will have to beg by the roadside. You will
sink lower and lower, until you get into the workhouse."</p>

<p>"No!" cried Meg, with a flash of confidence.
"Mrs. Browne will take me in."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Browne has left that house. It is occupied
by strangers who do not know you, who would
shut its doors upon you."</p>

<p>"Gone!" repeated Meg, aghast. "Where is she
gone to?"</p>

<p>"You will never know," said the stranger. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
after a moment he resumed: "If I had not been
driving down that road this evening you would
have begun your downward course already. Remember
what I say to you. If you try to escape again
you will become a little casual. A ruffianly porter
will let you in and order you about, you will be put
into a dirty bath, obliged to wear clothes other
beggars have worn before you."</p>

<p>"No, no! It can't be&mdash;it won't be!" cried
Meg.</p>

<p>"Who will prevent it?" said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish. He is my friend&mdash;he shall prevent
it! I will write to him&mdash;he will fetch me away!"
cried Meg incoherently, with a despairing sense of
the futility of her assertions.</p>

<p>"Where will you write to him?" asked the
stranger sharply. "Listen, child. You do not
deserve that I should trouble myself on your account,
and it seems as if you did not care to deserve that I
should. There was one whom I loved who proved
base and ungrateful. I left him to his fate."</p>

<p>He paused. Meg had not understood this mysterious
speech. Her blood grew cold. After a
moment the stranger resumed: "I do not doubt
this Mr. Standish showed you much kindness, and I
will not blame you because you are grateful to him;
but from the moment you left your former life Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Standish passed out of it. He does not know where
you are. He never will know. You do not know
where he is. I do not know it; I could tell you
nothing about him. Dismiss him from your
thoughts." He made a gesture as if, with his
uplifted hand, he were tearing the tie between her
and that friend of her childhood. "Remember
you owe duty and gratitude to another now. Be
silent!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I want to know where he is&mdash;I want to
know!" cried Meg, breaking again into incoherent
appeal.</p>

<p>The old gentleman did not reply. He sat there
silent, his face growing dimmer as the evening
deepened. Suddenly Meg realized the desolation
that had overtaken her, and throwing herself forward
with her face prone down upon the cushions,
she burst into weeping, with speechless sobs.</p>

<p>The stranger made no effort to comfort her.
When the paroxysm of weeping had spent itself
Meg turned her head, and saw that the night had
come. The stars were out in the sky. By their
light she dimly discerned the old gentleman's face.
She thought that he was looking at her, then she
saw that he lay back with his eyes closed, as if
asleep.</p>

<p>She did not move. A hope and an assurance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
which had hitherto filled her heart had gone out of
her life, and she lay there an atom of despair lost
in a void of desolation. The carriage drove noiselessly
on. She was vaguely aware of the still
freshness of the night spreading about her. She
knew when the carriage stopped, and when lights
flashed, and familiar voices, speaking excitedly,
sounded near. Still she did not stir.</p>

<p>She confusedly heard the old gentleman ask for
Miss Reeves, and this lady reply. She recognized
Miss Grantley's accents angrily asserting she ought
not to be taken back. Then again she knew the
stranger requested that she should be put to bed
and given some food, while he had a private talk
with the head-mistress.</p>

<p>Meg felt herself taken out; she recognized that
she was in Rachel's arms. She was carried upstairs
and undressed. She made no resistance, except to
refuse the food Rachel pressed upon her.</p>

<p>At last she lay in bed and in the dark, communing
and wrestling with her soul&mdash;living the
troublous day over again. Sometimes thinking
that she was once more struggling up that dusty
highway; that she was falling and stumbling
along; drifting away and then coming back to
half-consciousness; and then dreamily hearing the
thump, thump of crutches coming toward her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
catching a glimpse of a bright, bold face looking at
her.</p>

<p>As she lay there oppressed by the weariness and
bewilderment of that feverish time, a thirst for comfort
rose in her little heart. She vaguely heard the
rumble of carriage-wheels driving away, and she
knew the old gentleman was gone.</p>

<p>In her sadness and longing for solace Meg was
dropping off to sleep, when suddenly and softly she
felt a kiss alight upon her forehead. She did not
stir or question; she was too exhausted to wonder or
to fear. After the day's fever and alarm she could
not quail or wonder any more.</p>

<p>She fancied she heard light steps leave the room;
but that kiss had brought the solace she yearned
for, and she fell asleep.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>WHO GAVE THAT KISS.</h3>


<p>A year and a half had elapsed since that wild
outburst of rebellion against discipline had sent
Meg flying Londonward. She had settled down
into the routine of the school. Nothing now existed
for her outside its boundaries. She had parted
company with her childhood. The goblin past lay
behind her, and as she looked back upon it the child
who watched over the staircase almost appeared to
have been a visionary creature.</p>

<p>She concentrated all her attention upon her studies.
If still Miss Grantley was prejudiced against
her she won the approbation of her other teachers.
Signora Vallaria rolled her dark eyes as Meg's
fingers still lagged behind in execution; but there
was an energy, an intelligence in her apprehension
that made the signora, while wringing her hands,
yet consider Meg's lesson a treat to give. If Meg's
answers occasionally still lacked exactitude in the
historical class they were always roughly brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and intelligent. She was still apt to pass beyond
her own depth, but her fellow-pupils felt the impetus
of a rashness that was the outcome of energy.
Meg had an unconscious ascendency over her schoolmates.
A vigorous nature will always sway more
languid spirits; but her influence over them was
due rather to the fact that since she was eight years
of age she had begun to think, and, like all suffering
creatures, to observe. This power of observation,
of drawing her own conclusions, and of acting upon
them, was the secret of her ascendency over her
schoolfellows. It was the ascendency of character.</p>

<p>Some called her repellent; for there was a childlike
bluntness, a certain defiant awkwardness about
her still. Others, like Miss Pinkett, treated her
with contempt as a nameless waif. Others again,
like Gwendoline Lister, wove a web of romance
about her; nothing short of Meg being the deserted
child of a duchess satisfied the Beauty. Meg knew
she continued to be the object of this speculation,
and these castles in the air made about her future
wounded her, and she repelled curiosity. She still
remained solitary in that busy republic of girls.
Still her sensitive pride impelled her to refuse sweets
when offered to her, because she had none to give
in return; still she refused invitations, because she
could not ask others to be guests at her home.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>The day of her attempted flight had proved memorable;
that day of feverish adventures had brought
her an experience over which, in her loveless life,
she often pondered. That spectral kiss placed on
her forehead, which had brought such solace to her
as she lay in misery and loneliness, haunted her.
Who had given her that kiss? At first she had
thought it might be Miss Reeves to assure her of
pardon; but why should the schoolmistress have
made a mystery of her kindness? The balanced
composure and impartiality of the lady's manner
dispelled this conjecture. The more Meg saw Miss
Reeves the more she felt sure the lady would not
yield to any emotional demonstration, and, if she
yielded, she would not conceal it. Miss Grantley
could not have taken this fit of pity. Her frosty
behavior precluded its possibility. Then Meg
thought it might be the cook who was kind to her.</p>

<p>"Did you come up to my room that night when
I was going to sleep?" she asked the old servant;
but the surprised denial she received was conclusive.
Who then could have given her that kiss? It
could not be the old gentleman. She had heard the
wheels of his carriage driving down the garden, and
nothing could well be more unlikely or unlike his
stern, unsympathetic nature. There was no one
else in the house that day except the servants, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
no servant could have approached with that gliding
footfall. Meg sometimes fancied it might be her
dead mother attracted to her grieving child's bedside;
but Meg asked herself, "If it were, why had
she not come to kiss or comfort her before?" and
then she added, "there are no such things as
ghosts." But still this solution seemed to rest upon
her mind as a notion more akin to her feelings, if it
were the least probable explanation of the mystery.</p>

<p>Meg, during the year and a half that had elapsed,
had given way to no more bursts of impish rage;
she had become a reticent, grave, and silent girl.
She was rather stern-looking, but this expression of
sternness, if to a superficial observer it might have
seemed an outcome of her nature, was in truth but
that of a habit acquired by its enforced repression.
Her sympathies bid fair to languish and die from
want of soil, when an event happened which gave a
force and a color to her school-life.</p>

<p>One afternoon after class, Meg, entering the
schoolroom, perceived the girls gathered in a knot
at the further end. She pushed her way through
to discover what was attracting them. A golden-haired
child was the center of the group. She was
a new pupil come from India, and the girls were
lavishing caresses upon the little stranger. The
child was pretty and frail-looking enough to justify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
their enthusiastic effusiveness. She submitted to
the kisses and hugs and general petting with a half-resigned
air that suggested endurance of what she
was already over-satiated with, rather than gratitude
for the accorded welcome. Meg looked on,
unsympathizing with these cheap caresses, but still
attracted by the prettiness of the child as one
might be by a strange bird of great beauty. The
wistful gaze of large blue eyes encircled with lilac
shadows met hers; but still Meg took no notice,
repelled by that excess of demonstration lavished
upon the little stranger by the other girls. "They
don't see how they worry the poor little thing,"
she muttered as, taking up what she had come for,
she went upstairs.</p>

<p>Some time after, as she knelt before her trunk,
putting its contents in order, a slight touch on her
elbow caused her to look round.</p>

<p>"What pretty things!" said a little voice. It
was the child. With tiny fingers she pointed to
the gayly-bound volume Meg was restoring to the
box.</p>

<p>"There are pictures inside," Meg replied, turning
the pages. The child looked coldly at the prints.
She apparently did not care for the illustrations.
It was the gold-edged leaves and the gold pattern
on the cover which attracted her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"How it <i>sines</i>!" she said with her baby lisp, and
she passed her rosy fingertips over the gilding.</p>

<p>Meg looked at the bright hair falling in soft
abundance over the tiny shoulders, at the dark
lashes that shaded the eyes, surrounded by pearly
shadows, at the sculptured lips, the upper lip lying
softly curled over the lower. She thought she had
never seen anything so dainty and delicate as this
child. She seemed to be like a feather blown out of
heaven across her path.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Meg.</p>

<p>"Elsie," said the child; "and what is yours?"</p>

<p>"My name is Meg."</p>

<p>"Did your mamma give you those books?" asked
the child.</p>

<p>"I have no mamma," Meg replied curtly.</p>

<p>"I have no mamma either; she is dead," said
Elsie.</p>

<p>Meg was moved by one of those sudden emotions
which come with a rush. She lifted her box with
violence and carried it some paces off.</p>

<p>"How strong you are!" said the child. "Can
you lift me?"</p>

<p>Meg felt inclined to be impatient. Then, meeting
the glance of eyes the appeal of which was
irresistible, she took the child in her arms and
tossed her up.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>That night, through the silence of the dormitory,
Meg heard subdued sobbing. All the other girls
were asleep. Elsie's bed had been placed on the
other side of the room. Meg listened for a moment.
Her heart was wrung by that low sound of
weeping. She thought of her own anguish of loneliness,
and of that haunting kiss which had brought
such solace to her in her night of sorrow. After
awhile she stole out of bed, and bending over the
child, she kissed her forehead.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>MISS PINKETT'S DIAMOND.</h3>


<p>Elsie had taken a fancy to the stern, silent girl.
She put out all her little arts to please Meg. Indifferent
and inclined to be fitful to the girls who
petted her and offered to carry her in their arms,
she followed Meg about with pathetic persistence.
Meg felt the delight of a devoted nature, thankful
for opportunities given to it of sacrificing itself,
and mingled gratitude with the feeling she returned.
She devoted herself to Elsie. She played with her,
she taught her lessons, she spent time and ingenuity
in making learning easy to her; and Elsie accepted
this devotion. There was pity for Elsie mingled
in Meg's solicitude. She was so strong, and the
child looked so frail. She was so fearless, and
the child was as easily frightened as a little bird.
A severe word made Elsie tremble; and it was
pitiful to see the little hands, with their network
of veins, trembling at any harshness.</p>

<p>The girls were astonished to see a return of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
terrible Meg one day when Laura was teasing Elsie,
mimicking her nervous ways, her frightened starts
and turns of the head. Meg suddenly leaped forward
and pushed Laura with such force that this
damsel found herself sitting on the ground at some
yards' distance.</p>

<p>"How dare you be so cruel to a little child!"
Meg said, standing between Elsie and her tormentor.</p>

<p>"I shall have you punished, you gypsy!" Miss
Laura replied.</p>

<p>"Have me punished if you like," said Meg; "but
if you dare hurt this child I will give it to you
again."</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the child which perplexed Meg,
besides an almost abnormal timidity, was the
singular fascination exercised over her by bright
objects. Like a little grayling that rises to the
light, every shining object attracted Elsie. It
seemed almost uncanny to Meg, whose æsthetic
sense was yet in its elementary stage, and who was
unconsciously stirred by the moral suggestiveness
of beauty, rather than by its physical appeal.
Flowers, birds, Elsie herself, came to her as vague
yet tangible revelations of a greater calm, a higher
goodness and sweetness than earth holds. Elsie's
delight in brilliancy was purely sensuous, and its
influence over her nervous little frame puzzled Meg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
A Salviati glass that stood in Miss Reeves' sanctum
fascinated the child. She seized every opportunity
to catch a sight of the wonderful vase; the shifting
opal tints seemed to throw her into an excited
dream. She would go and peep at it through the
open door. Meg missed her one day from the playground,
and found her perched on a chair in the
room no one was allowed to enter without the
mistress' permission, touching the vase, cooing and
kissing the cold and glittering glass.</p>

<p>"Come down, Elsie! You must not come in
here, you know, without Miss Reeves' permission,"
she said, alarmed, gently taking the child up in her
arms. Then as Elsie struggled she went on:
"Everything in this room is a present from an old
pupil or a friend. Everything is very dear to Miss
Reeves in it. She would be very angry if an accident
happened to the vase. You would be punished
for disobedience."</p>

<p>Elsie at this prospect let Meg carry her away,
but she began to cry:</p>

<p>"I want it&mdash;I want it. I want to take it to bed
with me! I want to have it all to myself!"</p>

<p>Meg soothed her. She endeavored to divert her
attention by telling her the story of a mine of diamonds,
more wonderful than that of the field of
diamonds in "Sindbad the Sailor." For Elsie's sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Meg had developed the gift of telling stories. Her
inventive powers were as the wand of a magician
over the child. Her tales were distinguished by a
touch of the grotesque and grewsome, a spice of
humor and adventure. Meg's voice, which was of
a peculiar quality, helped the effect. It was low
and feeling at times, and again it had a spirited emphasis
kept under gentle restraint. A child was
the heroine of these stories, inspired by incidents
enlarged upon and drawn from her childish recollections.</p>

<p>The stories that attracted Elsie most were those
of splendor and of perfume. She would listen enthralled
to the adventures in the bowels of the
earth of a little girl, who met there the giant who
took care of the fire, the sparks of which formed
the diamonds, rubies, and topaz.</p>

<p>One day Elsie crept like a lizard to Meg's side.
Miss Pinkett, who was a parlor-boarder now, had
certain privileges, and was going to a party. She
had called Elsie in to see her dressed, and she had
shown the child a diamond star her father had sent
from India on her last birthday.</p>

<p>"She put it here"&mdash;Elsie's little hand touched
her forehead. "It looked all alive, twinkling&mdash;twinkling!
It was more beautiful than the glass
vase. It shot out now a lovely red ray, then a yel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>low
light or a bit of shiny blue. Miss Pinkett said
her mother had more beautiful diamonds," Elsie
concluded, with a sigh of exhausted happiness.</p>

<p>"It is only a bit of coal&mdash;black coal that has been
buried a long time in the earth," Meg replied with
practical coldness.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it. It shines&mdash;shines&mdash;shines!"
said the child. "Do you think Miss Pinkett
would let me touch it, put it on, and play with it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Meg bluntly. "I would not ask
her. You might lose it, and she would never forgive
you."</p>

<p>But the diamond star had taken possession of
Elsie's mind, and the fear of punishment did not
lift the spell it exercised.</p>

<p>"Do you see that little red-morocco box?&mdash;it is
in there. I saw her put it in there," she whispered
to Meg next morning, dragging her by the skirt
into the room Miss Pinkett still shared with Miss
Lister alone.</p>

<p>"Do leave that diamond alone," said Meg
brusquely. "Don't think of it so much, Elsie. It
will get you into trouble and you will get punished.
Did you ever see a drop of water through a microscope?
That is ever so much more wonderful. Dr.
Flite showed us this at the chemistry class this
morning."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care for drops of water," said Elsie pettishly.</p>

<p>"There are monsters in it that fight each other
and eat each other up. I'll tell you a story about a
drop of water," said Meg suggestively, still trying
to divert Elsie's attention.</p>

<p>One morning Meg was running down the corridor
that led out of the dormitories.</p>

<p>"Meg, Meg!" called a little voice in a whisper.
Meg looked round; it was Elsie standing at Miss
Pinkett's door. She was holding something in the
palm of her small, shaking hand. Meg, approaching,
saw it was the diamond star.</p>

<p>"Elsie, put it back at once," she said peremptorily.</p>

<p>"The box was open. I saw it shining and I took
it out. I could not help it. Is it not lovely?"</p>

<p>The tiny fingers caressed the stone, and the baby
voice gurgled and laughed to it.</p>

<p>"You will get into trouble, and I shall not be able
to save you from being punished," said Meg. "Put
it back."</p>

<p>As she spoke Elsie gave a sudden start, dropped
the diamond, and took to flight.</p>

<p>Meg picked up the gem and went inside the room
to place it in its box. She encountered Miss Pinkett
and Miss Lister coming in by another door.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you doing in my room?" asked Miss
Pinkett coldly.</p>

<p>Meg, without answering, put down the diamond.</p>

<p>Miss Pinkett flushed. "What right have you to
touch anything of mine&mdash;this diamond especially?"</p>

<p>Meg remained silent, as if pondering what she
would say.</p>

<p>"If I find you fingering anything that belongs to
me I will report you, Miss Beecham," resumed Miss
Pinkett in her most chilly tones.</p>

<p>"You ought to lock up your diamond," said Meg,
at last, with an effort. "It it not right to leave it
about&mdash;not right to others. It might bring some
one into temptation."</p>

<p>"I understand," replied Miss Pinkett with cutting
point. "I see there is necessity to lock it up." She
shut the box with a snap, and closed the drawer
with an elaborate jingle of keys.</p>

<p>The diamond was hidden, but Elsie still thought
of it. One evening, as Meg sat on the window sill
absorbed in reading an account of the condor, and
following with tremendous interest the flight of the
bird over mountain and seas, Elsie suddenly interrupted
her.</p>

<p>She pointed to the evening star hanging in the
suffused light of the sunset. "I wonder if papa
sees that star in India," she said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not just now, at any rate," answered Meg a
little roughly. Any sign of yearning in Elsie's
voice affected her painfully.</p>

<p>"Do you think Miss Pinkett's lovely jewel is like
that star?" said Elsie, after a pause.</p>

<p>"No, it is not more like it than a lighted lucifer
match is like a sun," replied Meg.</p>

<p>"She is gone out to a dinner-party to-night, and
she did not wear it. I wonder why," continued the
child, undismayed by the blunt reply.</p>

<p>"I do not care for that diamond more than if it
were a pebble from the gravel of the playground,"
answered Meg impatiently; then with abrupt transition
she asked, "Did you ever hear of the condor?"</p>

<p>"The what?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"The condor," repeated Meg, and she pointed to
the picture of the bird. But Elsie's mind was not to
be so easily diverted.</p>

<p>"If I had that diamond," she said in a subdued
tone, "I would carry it about wherever I went. I
would talk to it, and kiss it."</p>

<p>"I think," said Meg, "that if you had it you
would want nothing but that hard, glittering stone."</p>

<p>"Nothing! At night I would put it under my
pillow and it would come into a dream," continued
Elsie.</p>

<p>"You dream of it already," said Meg impatiently.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me a story about it," replied
Elsie with a sigh.</p>

<p>Meg shut her book. She drew her breath heavily</p>

<p>"I don't like that diamond," she said. Then
pausing, she began abruptly:</p>

<p>"Once upon a time there was a little girl like
you, who wanted a diamond, and she cared for nothing
because she could not get that diamond; and a
spirit put her into a small bare world all alone, to
own it and be its queen. And the spirit gave her
a beautiful diamond, twenty times as big and as
beautiful as that one of Miss Pinkett's."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Elsie, with a pant.</p>

<p>"The little girl," went on Meg, "jumped about
for joy, and said she would want nothing now that
she had this diamond.</p>

<p>"And the spirit said to her, 'There is something
better and more beautiful than this diamond. When
you have got tired of that jewel you will find this
out, and then you will want that greater blessing.'"</p>

<p>"Blessing!" repeated Elsie petulantly. "I am
sure she never did want anything more."</p>

<p>"And so the little girl," continued Meg, "talked
to her diamond, and kissed it, and put it under her
pillow at night and dreamed of it. But the diamond
did not answer her, did not kiss her back; if she were
sad or if she were glad it glittered the same. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the little girl at last grew tired of the diamond. It
was not a companion. She felt a great want.
There is something better, she thought; something
that would be good and pleasant to have in sorrow
as well as in joy. She asked the spirit to tell her
what was that better thing. But the spirit did not
answer. So the little girl went wandering about
her bare world to find it. She walked till she was
footsore, and still she could not find it; for she did
not know what it was. Only she yearned for it.
One night she was so weary and lonely that she
felt as if she must die, and she prayed to the spirit
to have pity upon her and give her that better
thing; and at last it came to her."</p>

<p>"What was it?" said Elsie eagerly.</p>

<p>"She was dropping off to sleep, sobbing to herself
in her weariness and solitariness, when on her
forehead there was laid a soft kiss."</p>

<p>"A kiss!" repeated Elsie in a tone of disappointment.</p>

<p>"It was a kiss of love, like this," said Meg, bending
forward and gently kissing Elsie's forehead.
"And when she felt this kiss the fatigue, the loneliness
and sadness left her, and the next morning she
awoke quite happy."</p>

<p>"Was it the spirit gave her the kiss?" asked
Elsie, with cold interest.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"She sometimes thought it was," said Meg.</p>

<p>"And the diamond&mdash;what became of the diamond?"
asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"It had vanished," said Meg.</p>

<p>"I do not like that story," said Elsie pettishly;
but she remained thoughtful by Meg's side.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>THE PARTY.</h3>


<p>Meg thought that a change had come over Elsie.
The child was attentive at her lessons, and softly
dependent upon the protection of her friend.
Elsie's mind had also become full of a school-party
that was shortly to be given. There were to be
theatricals. Miss Pinkett, who was to leave school
after this term, was to play a grand piece on the
pianoforte. The evening was to close with dancing.
Some of the girls' brothers were asked to the party.
Elsie was to take part in the theatricals&mdash;she was
to appear as a fairy, in a white dress ornamented
with tinsel.</p>

<p>Nothing else but the coming party was talked of.
The girls discussed the festivity between lessons,
and it was the theme of their speculation as they
walked abroad. Meg alone was uninterested, and
would have wished to escape and remain in her
room that night. On the appointed day there were
no lessons, and the schoolroom was decorated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
flowers and sketches; the pupils lending their aid
and their taste to Signora Vallaria, who supervised
the arrangements.</p>

<p>The evening was approaching. All the girls who
were to take part in the theatricals had dropped in
one by one dressed for their parts. There was to
be a rehearsal before the guests arrived. Elsie
alone was missing. Meg sought her high and low.
Once she thought she caught sight of the little
figure in Miss Pinkett's room, but when she entered
she found the room empty. As she was turning
away she encountered Miss Pinkett, who looked at
her with surprised coldness.</p>

<p>"I was looking for Elsie," Meg explained.</p>

<p>"She is not in the habit of coming into my room
uninvited," replied Miss Pinkett. "Indeed no one
is but yourself, Miss Beecham," and Miss Pinkett
shut the door without waiting for Meg's reply.</p>

<p>The dress rehearsal had begun without Elsie,
when suddenly the door flew open and Miss Pinkett
entered in great agitation. Her diamond star was
gone. Had any one seen it? The case was on the
table where she had put it, but it was empty.
Blank astonishment greeted the announcement.
There was a rush to the young lady's room to help
in the hunt for the missing jewel. The servants
were called and asked if any of them had seen it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
but all declared they had not entered that room.
At last all adjourned to the schoolroom, where the
wild excitement resolved itself into a solemn inquiry
as to who had been last in Miss Pinkett's
room. Whispers grew around Meg. More than
one glance of suspicion was turned upon her. At
last Miss Reeves asked quietly, "What were you
doing, Miss Beecham, in Miss Pinkett's room a little
while ago?"</p>

<p>"I?" replied Meg, amazed.</p>

<p>"You cannot deny that you were there. I met
you there!" Miss Pinkett rejoined excitedly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Meg. She looked
round in a dazed manner, then a sudden fury
gripped her throat as she understood the drift of
the questions.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you accuse me of
stealing?"</p>

<p>"It does not amount to an accusation," said Miss
Reeves. "I only ask you what you were doing in
Miss Pinkett's room?"</p>

<p>"I never touched the diamond star," said
Meg.</p>

<p>"Never! Do you mean," cried Miss Pinkett,
"that you did not touch it that day I found you in
my room with the diamond in your hand?"</p>

<p>"I touched it that day," said Meg, and paused;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
she had caught sight of Elsie, cowering pale and
trembling against the wall.</p>

<p>"Why did you touch it? Why did you say I
ought not to leave it about?" hotly questioned Miss
Pinkett.</p>

<p>"I had a reason for touching it that day."</p>

<p>"What reason?" asked Miss Reeves.</p>

<p>"One which I cannot tell. It was a good reason.
Believe it or not, I don't care. But I did not touch
it to-day. I did not see it."</p>

<p>"You were in my room," said Miss Pinkett, "and
the diamond case was on the table, and the diamond
was in it, I know."</p>

<p>"I was in your room," Meg began.</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Miss Pinkett.</p>

<p>"I was looking"&mdash;again Meg encountered that
appealing look from Elsie, cowering a white trembling
little scrap against the wall.</p>

<p>"Your explanations are lame," said Miss Reeves
gravely.</p>

<p>"I don't care if they are lame or not," Meg interrupted
fiercely. "I have not taken that diamond.
That is all I have to say. I have not taken it. I
had it one day in my hand. Appearances may be
so far against me; but if you condemn me on that,
you do it out of your hatred to me."</p>

<p>"Hush, Miss Beecham!" said Miss Reeves severely.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"You hate and despise me because I have no one
who belongs to me in the world," continued Meg.
"You call me a gypsy girl and a tramp, that's what
you call me. I don't care if you hate and despise
me. I can't help what I was born, and I don't want
to help it. What I know is that I have not taken
that diamond."</p>

<p>A murmur ran round the room, but Meg did not
pause to consider its nature. She turned in her ungovernable
indignation, and pushing through her
companions she flung open the door and slammed
it after her. Again she caught a glimpse of Elsie's
terrorized face and figure as she rushed past.</p>

<p>She went out into the playground to breathe the
fresh air, trembling with fury. The old wild self
had returned to her, taking with it seven devils.
Her heart felt too big for her breast. Tearless
sobs shook her as with all the vehemence of her
spirit she repelled the charge brought against
her.</p>

<p>Then again she seemed to see before her the
wretched, cringing little figure of Elsie, and the
large eyes fixed wistfully upon her. A suspicion
fell cold and terrible on Meg's heart and checked
her wrath. She had vaguely interpreted that look
as an entreaty not to reveal Elsie's admiration for
the gem. It seemed now to convey another mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>ing.
How could she see that child alone, get a few
secret words with her?</p>

<p>She went indoors, and in the hall she met Elsie,
like a little ghost, furtively creeping out, holding
something in her shaking hand.</p>

<p>"What is it, Elsie?"</p>

<p>"They are going to search our things, everybody's
things," gasped Elsie. "I am going to throw
it away."</p>

<p>"Throw what away?" asked Meg energetically.</p>

<p>"The diamond," the convulsive voice of the child
answered; and still she held something tight hidden
in the small shaking hand covered with a network
of blue veins.</p>

<p>"Oh, Elsie, did you take the diamond?" asked
Meg sadly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought&mdash;I thought Miss Pinkett would
not wear it. I wanted to have it for one night. I&mdash;I
thought she would not find it out. I heard her
say she was not going to wear it. Where shall I
throw it away?"</p>

<p>"You must not throw it away," said Meg.
"Some one else would be suspected. Come, Elsie,
you must be brave. You must say that you took
it. Come with me, I'll say it for you."</p>

<p>She put her arm about the child. But Elsie
struggled like a little mad animal from her grasp.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no; don't say it was I&mdash;don't say it was I!"</p>

<p>An infinite compassion seized Meg when she saw
the big tears welling in Elsie's eyes, and she asked
herself how she could save this little one. Pity
grew into the stronger motive and smothered fear.
It was Meg's nature that what she undertook to do
she did thoroughly.</p>

<p>"I will ask to be punished in your stead, Elsie,"
she said.</p>

<p>"They won't punish you for me&mdash;they won't let
you be punished for me!"</p>

<p>Meg drew her breath.</p>

<p>"They don't think it is I&mdash;they don't think it
is I!" sobbed Elsie, clinging to Meg. "Don't say
it is I!"</p>

<p>The child was cold with anguish.</p>

<p>"Very well; I will not say it is you."</p>

<p>"You'll not say it&mdash;you'll not say it?" repeated
Elsie, clinging to Meg's skirt.</p>

<p>"No; I'll manage it," said Meg.</p>

<p>"How will you manage it? Who will give the
diamond up?"</p>

<p>"I," said Meg.</p>

<p>The child put her arms round Meg's neck, kissing
her over and over again, and reiterating her cry
not to say she had taken it.</p>

<p>Meg put her gently away, marched out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
went straight into the room where all were
assembled.</p>

<p>Miss Reeves with Signora Vallaria and two other
teachers were preparing for the search of the boxes.
Meg walked up to the head-mistress.</p>

<p>"There is the diamond!" she said, holding it out
with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>A dead pause greeted this speech. Then Miss
Pinkett's laugh rippled up.</p>

<p>"I thought so," she said.</p>

<p>Miss Reeves took the jewel, lifting her hand to
enjoin silence.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I return Miss Pinkett's diamond," Meg replied.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you took it notwithstanding
your repudiation of the accusation which
shamed some of us into believing you innocent?"</p>

<p>"I restore it now," said Meg huskily.</p>

<p>"Had you heard that the boxes were to be
searched?" demanded Miss Reeves.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Meg.</p>

<p>Again there was a pause.</p>

<p>"I will stake my word upon it, there is a
mystery," said Signora Vallaria, fixing her dark
eyes upon Meg.</p>

<p>"Miss Beecham," resumed Miss Reeves, "did you
take this diamond?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Meg remained silent.</p>

<p>"I repeat the question," said Miss Reeves. "Did
you take this diamond?"</p>

<p>"I restore it, and I am ready to submit to any
punishment you may decree. Is that not sufficient
answer?"</p>

<p>Again there was a murmur round the room.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it is a sufficient answer," said Miss
Reeves gravely. "The punishment is expulsion
from school. I give you till to-morrow morning,
Miss Beecham, to explain your strange conduct.
You cannot attend the party. You have turned an
occasion of festivity into one of humiliation and unhappiness
for us all. Go upstairs. You can no
longer occupy the dormitory with your fellow-pupils.
You will be taken to a room on the other side of
the corridor where you will sleep alone. Miss
Grantley will show you the way."</p>

<p>Meg turned to follow her guide in silence. The
stern girl seemed turned to stone.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>POOR MEG.</h3>


<p>Through the evening Meg heard the intolerable
dance music going on and on. Little by little there
came to her in her isolation the realization of the
thankless load she had taken upon herself&mdash;a burden
of guilt of the meanest kind. What would Mr.
Standish think of her now? He had for some time
past fallen into the background of her thoughts;
but now there returned to her the memory of this
friend of her childhood. With anguish she felt that
when they met again, instead of appearing before
him grown into a lady, full of the grace of blossomed
womanly ways, and with the dignity which
comes of loving protection to the weak, what would
she seem to him? For years, thought Meg, for all
her life, she must seem a miserable wretch and a
thief.</p>

<p>She walked up and down the little room contemplating
this picture. She could not face the prospect;
and still, as there rose before her that vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of a cringing, shrinking child, an atom of terror
outlined there against the darkness, appealing to
her, Meg once more took up the load of guilt. Up
and down she wandered, unable to concentrate her
thoughts, sometimes contemplating how two hours
ago she was a different being&mdash;all the change that
had happened in two little hours!&mdash;then feeling
that one comfort remained to her&mdash;the thought of
Elsie's gratitude. In an alien world this little blossom
of love would sweeten her lot. She turned
from the realization of her own ruin to linger on
this consolation that round Elsie's heart would hang
the rich perfume of thankfulness for the sacrifice
she had made. And then still, as she walked up
and down, she thought how downstairs as they
danced they all knew it. She was worse to them
than a beggar in the streets. "If I were to go
downstairs they would all shrink from me," she
muttered bitterly. There was a stain upon her
never to be wiped off. In two years would it be
forgotten? she asked herself drearily. No, it would
not. In three years? No, it never will, answered
the thought; and then always, like the burden of
her plaint, that Mr. Standish would hear of it.</p>

<p>The intolerable dance music stopped at last. She
heard the rustle of dresses, the rush of feet. The
party was over. The girls were going to bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
The gas was turned off and the house was plunged
into darkness.</p>

<p>Meg lay down upon her bed and from sheer
fatigue of sorrow fell asleep. She woke with the
dawn, and for a moment she forgot what had happened.
Then the heavy misery shaped itself and
pressed upon her soul again. The calm morning
held a promise of hope. What would the day bring
her? Would not Elsie tell?</p>

<p>Just before the bell for prayers rang she heard
a step outside. The handle of the door turned and
Miss Reeves entered.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence as the head mistress
and the pupil faced each other.</p>

<p>"Meg, how did that diamond come into your
possession?" Miss Reeves asked, not unkindly.</p>

<p>Meg did not answer.</p>

<p>"Will you not explain? I have come here to win
your confidence. Why did you not return it before
the order came for searching the boxes?"</p>

<p>A passing moment of temptation came to Meg
to explain, to admit that certain reasons kept her
silent, but she sternly repressed the impulse.</p>

<p>She repeated what she had said before&mdash;she had
restored the jewel, was that not enough? She would
say nothing more.</p>

<p>"Then," said Miss Reeves sternly, "I can give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
but one interpretation to your obstinate silence.
You are guilty of an act which seems to me the
meanest that ever occurred in my school. There
remains but one course for me to take. I will write
to your guardian. You must be removed at once.
The disgrace of your presence must be removed
from your comrades. You will join your schoolfellows
at prayer-times only. Your meals will be
brought up and served to you here. I must forbid
you to address any of your schoolfellows; nor must
you speak to any of your teachers except to make
the small reparation of a full confession."</p>

<p>Miss Reeves turned and left the room with cold
stateliness. Meg remained standing where she was
till the prayer-bell rang. The fury of the night
was over. Her mind seemed a void. She could
think no more, scarcely could she suffer. When
the bell ceased, she left the room. A few laggard
girls were hurrying out of the dormitory. They
passed her with averted faces and in silence; and
they whispered with each other. There came upon
Meg the first bitterness of the realization that she
was an outcast from the community.</p>

<p>She entered the room where all were assembled,
feeling dizzy. Then a sort of courage of indignation
came upon her, for she was innocent. She
looked in the direction of Elsie's place, eager to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
receive a glance that would repay her for all that she
was bearing; but Elsie's eyes were carefully turned in
another direction, and she appeared bent upon hiding
behind another girl, as if to avoid seeing Meg. A
pang of anguish shot through Meg's heart. Was that
little hand lifted with the others against her? Was
Elsie also thrusting her out as did all those who
refused her fellowship in their lot? She felt so
dazed that she remained for a moment standing,
unaware of the general kneeling around her as
Miss Reeves' voice was raised in prayer. Then her
heart began to harden, and she looked toward Elsie
no more.</p>

<p>When the girls were filing out she thought she
would give Elsie another chance. The child must
pass her in going out. Meg was conscious of her
pet's approach, although she did not openly look her
way. She felt if she watched Elsie and the
child made an advance it would not be spontaneous.
And yet, when there came no furtive touch on her
hand, no whispered word as Elsie passed, Meg could
not withhold from glancing toward her. Yes,
Elsie had passed with eyes averted. That last link
of sympathy which had given her hope gave way
and broke.</p>

<p>Meg went up to her room, and the day passed.
She sat with her chin buried in her hands looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
heavily out. She felt stunned; she no longer protested
or pondered over the future. At prayer-time
that evening she did not look toward Elsie.</p>

<p>The next morning there was again a moment of
forgetfulness when she awoke. Then again the
horror gradually shaped itself, but this morning
nature brought to her no reassurance. At the
sound of the bell Meg rose with a heart like
lead. She dressed herself and went down slowly.
A mood of indignant bitterness had replaced the
chilled misery of her bewildered heart. After
prayers Miss Reeves informed her that she had
received a letter from Mr. Fullbloom. He would
fetch her away that afternoon. She must be prepared
to leave then.</p>

<p>Meg received the news mutely, and went upstairs
to begin her packing as directed.</p>

<p>She mechanically folded and put her belongings
into her trunk. When she took out the presents
Mr. Standish had given her, and that bore the
marks of much handling, a movement of enraged
despair seized her, and she trembled. "He'll never
care to see me again, and how could I see him?"
she muttered.</p>

<p>The girls were out in the playground as she finished
her task. "I'll be glad to get away!" she
said, as she sat on her box a moment and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
round her. But even as she said this her mind
called up before her the departure. "Where am I
going to?" she muttered. With compressed lips
she whispered to herself as she rose, "No matter!
no matter!"</p>

<p>It was two o'clock; in less than an hour she
knew Mr. Fullbloom would be here. Her trunk,
locked and strapped, stood in a corner; her hat and
cloak lay upon it ready to be put on at his summons.
No one had come near her. All her preparations
were made. The old restlessness had
returned; and she was walking up and down, thinking,
thinking where was she to go to. What would
happen to her?</p>

<p>"Meg! Meg!" said a little voice in a whisper.
She turned; it was Elsie standing on the threshold
of the door. There was a pause, during which Meg
eyed the little figure, huddling up into a corner, its
hands convulsively working together with a pitiful
resemblance to older grief.</p>

<p>"Speak to me, Meg! won't you speak to me? I
am so miserable," lisped the child piteously.</p>

<p>"You ought to be," replied Meg.</p>

<p>"If they would only let me go away with you!"
moaned the child. "Oh, Meg, if they would only
let me go away with you!"</p>

<p>"How could they let you go with me? I am a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
thief; you are a white, pure, innocent child," Meg
said in bitter sarcasm.</p>

<p>"It is I who am wicked, not you. Oh, Meg, I
love you so much, I love you so much!" reiterated
the child, with that piteous quaver in her voice,
stealing into the room, still wringing her little
hands.</p>

<p>"Love me!" repeated Meg, her voice shrilly
bitter; "and you do as the others do. You turn
your face away when I come into the room."</p>

<p>"I am frightened, I am frightened. The girls
say no one must look at you, or talk to you. I am
frightened."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you are frightened," Meg replied
with softened gruffness. Elsie looked changed, she
seemed a little wasted.</p>

<p>"I cannot sleep. Oh, Meg, I cannot sleep, I am
so miserable!" sobbed Elsie, touching Meg's dress.</p>

<p>A pang of pity shot through Meg's heart.</p>

<p>"Hush! Elsie. Never mind, never mind," she
said, stroking the child's hair. "Don't speak loud,
some one may be listening."</p>

<p>"I wish I could tell," said Elsie, with heaving
bosom. "I try to make myself tell. It stops here!"
and the child put her hand to her throat. "I try
to say I took it; but I can't, I can't. And you
won't tell, Meg, you won't tell?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I won't," said Meg. "I won't. Do not be
afraid, my pet."</p>

<p>She kept stroking Elsie's hair, grateful for that
moment of solace.</p>

<p>"I wish I were dead!" cried Elsie, with a sudden
wail, flinging herself into Meg's arms.</p>

<p>"Come away this moment!" said a voice, and a
hand took hold of Elsie and dragged her away.</p>

<p>Meg recognized Ursula. She stood stock-still for
a moment. Then she threw herself prone down
upon the ground with a passionate cry.</p>

<p>That touch of comfort so rudely taken from her;
that word of love from the child who had most right
to give her love, silenced so abruptly! Why?
Because in their rude honesty her comrades had
decreed to exile her and abhor her like a thief.</p>

<p>She remained with her face pressed down to the
ground, as if she would press herself into the heart
of the cold floor. Vaguely she was aware of the
bell ringing as for classes, and she knew the time
had come&mdash;in a few moments more she would be
gone on her way. But she did not move.</p>

<p>She became aware of steps approaching. Some
one touched her on the shoulder. Ursula's voice
said, "Meg, you must come down at once."</p>

<p>Meg turned her head round.</p>

<p>"You must come down at once," repeated Ursula,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
as Meg kept looking at her stupidly. "You had
better come down," continued Ursula gently, putting
her hand upon hers. Meg rose.</p>

<p>"I am going, but I will go alone," she said with
returning fierceness, flinging Ursula's hand away.
She pushed her hair roughly from her eyes and
went toward her trunk to put on her hat and cloak.</p>

<p>"You need not put on your things," said Ursula.
"It is in the schoolroom you are wanted."</p>

<p>"In the schoolroom? Very well," said Meg.
She passed Ursula. She went downstairs, and with
a reckless bang she opened the schoolroom door.
What new ordeal or humiliation was awaiting her?</p>

<p>The room was full. Miss Reeves advanced to
meet her.</p>

<p>"Miss Beecham," said the head-mistress, "Elsie
has confessed everything. Young ladies, I have
sent for you all, for before you all Miss Beecham
was declared guilty and before you all she must be
cleared of this charge. She is entirely innocent."</p>

<p>The ground seemed to sink under Meg's feet; the
surroundings to fade away as in a splendor. She
was aware of a murmur all round her, of the girls
looking at her with a new expression of regret.</p>

<p>"Has Elsie confessed?" she panted.</p>

<p>"Not of her own free will," replied Miss Reeves
gravely. "She was forced to confess by the sud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>deness
of Ursula's action. Ursula had crept up to
say good-by to you. She never thought you guilty.
When she came into your room she overheard
enough to convince her of the truth. She dragged
Elsie before me, and forced her to tell. It was not
a right thing, Meg, to shield this action. But it
was so generous I cannot blame you. You were
ready to sacrifice yourself for a child who would
have let you go forth disgraced."</p>

<p>"It was splendid!" said Ursula. "Meg Beecham
is a noble girl."</p>

<p>"She is," circled round the room.</p>

<p>Then Miss Pinkett stepped forth, elegant and
straight-backed even in her evident emotion. Tears
stood in her eyes, yet her voice was high-pitched
and smooth.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Beecham; I apologize
with all my heart to you. It was I who first
accused you. Will you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"I forgive you," said Meg automatically, taking
Miss Pinkett's extended hand. Then Ursula, with
spectacles shining with tears, came forward and
kissed Meg, who received the embrace in the same
dazed fashion. All the girls trooped around, taking
her listless hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly Meg recognized Elsie standing alone,
wringing her little hands with that piteous gesture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of older grieving. Sinking down on her knees, she
stretched out her arms.</p>

<p>"Elsie, Elsie!" she cried, and in a moment the
sobbing child was clasped to her heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Reeves, Miss Pinkett, young ladies!"
said Meg, looking round, holding Elsie tight, tears
coursing down her cheeks, "do not punish her, she
is so little, so tender. She took the diamond as a
child might take a shining bit of glass, only because
it was pretty. Do not punish her, she is so delicate,
so little! It was fright that kept her silent.
Forgive her!"</p>

<p>There was a pause, broken by Elsie's sobs, repeated
in various corners of the room.</p>

<p>"How can Elsie be forgiven?" said Miss Reeves
gravely. "Worse than taking the diamond was her
willingness to let another be expelled."</p>

<p>Then again Miss Pinkett stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Madam," she said, "we owe Meg Beecham some
reparation. I owe it to her more than any one.
For Meg's sake, pray let Elsie go unpunished!"</p>

<p>"For Meg's sake!" said Ursula, seconding Miss
Pinkett's petition.</p>

<p>"For Meg's sake!" was repeated all round the
room.</p>

<p>Miss Reeves hesitated. Then laying her hand on
Elsie's head:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let it be so. For Meg's sake you shall be forgiven;
for the sake of the girl whom you would
have injured beyond words to tell, you shall go unpunished.
This miserable incident will never be
referred to again. That is all that we can do to
make it up to Meg&mdash;to forgive you, Elsie, for her
sake."</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>PEACE.</h3>


<p>Meg was courted now by her schoolfellows; but
the attention lavished upon her wounded her pride.
She measured by it the contempt that had so easily
accused her of thieving. To her sensitive spirit this
kindness seemed insulting. It said, "We thought
you a thief, and we find you are not." She responded
coldly to advances made to her by all but
Ursula.</p>

<p>The girls did not reproach Elsie; a sense of fair
play kept them from referring to the diamond episode,
but they shunned her. They stuck to the
letter of the promised forgiveness, but they did not
forget that she was a little thief. Meg watched
the small figure lying apart and solitary in the
play-hours&mdash;a white drift upon the bench.</p>

<p>Her heart bled. The child had been so caressed
before, and was now an outcast. She remembered
how she, too, had been neglected and shunned; but
she was strong, and had never known petting, and
her anger was stirred against the girls.</p>

<p>She tried to make it up to Elsie; but a change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
had come over the child, and she shrank from her
friend. Meg knew Elsie felt ashamed, and she
busied herself about the child to prove that the sorrowful
time was not forgiven only, but forgotten
also. She watched her opportunities to help the
little one at her lessons; to put away her books,
pencils, and other belongings. Elsie refused help,
and avoided giving Meg those opportunities. The
old clinging ways were gone. The chattering voice
was hushed. A circle of ice seemed to surround
the child.</p>

<p>Meg felt lonely and blank; and pity mingled
with her desolateness. All the graceful radiance of
childhood had gone from Elsie. Meg knew the
change was due to remorse; the shyness of guilt
was upon Elsie's heart. She longed to make the
child smile and prattle again. As Elsie had longed
for that foolish diamond, so Meg longed for Elsie's
smile and prattle.</p>

<p>April had come; there were violets and primroses
in the woods about Moorhouse, and Miss Reeves
announced that the Saturday half-holiday might be
spent afield. Meg determined that to-day she would
conquer her pet's shrinking&mdash;that she would win
that laugh. She went to look for Elsie. She found
her lying listlessly on a bench in the sunshine. As
she approached Elsie turned her face away.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are going out into the country to pick
flowers," said Meg, kneeling beside her.</p>

<p>Elsie did not answer, and made a little movement
with her elbow as if to wave Meg away.</p>

<p>"We are not to walk two and two together like
soldiers," Meg went on, taking no notice. "When
we get to the woods we are to break up our ranks
and run wild. You and I will hunt for violets
together."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go," said Elsie.</p>

<p>"You are not well, my pet," said Meg, patting the
little hand.</p>

<p>"I am quite well," said Elsie harshly. "I do not
want to go, that is all."</p>

<p>"Then I will not go either. I will stop with
you," said Meg determinedly.</p>

<p>"No, no, no. I don't want you to stop with me!
I don't want you!" replied Elsie with hurried emphasis.
"I want to be alone. Of all the girls you
are the one I want most to be left alone by."</p>

<p>"Why do you hate me, Elsie?" asked Meg gently.</p>

<p>"I don't hate you," replied Elsie, after a pause, in
a faint, quavering voice. Then she added with
labored utterance: "I am ashamed. Every time
you look at me, every time you come near me, I am
ashamed." Her voice gathered energy, while her
breast heaved with tearless sobs. "The other girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
look at me as if they were always thinking 'She is
a thief,' and I don't mind&mdash;their looks not half (sob,
sob) so much&mdash;as&mdash;I mind&mdash;your kind look. It
makes me think&mdash;of&mdash;my dreadful wickedness."</p>

<p>"I look at you like that because I love you so
dearly," said Meg, seeking to draw the child to her.</p>

<p>Elsie struggled and sobbed, but at last she let
Meg take her on her lap and lean her cheek down
on her head. It seemed to Meg as if the circle of
ice were broken. She did not know what to say
that would soothe that stricken little conscience,
and yet guide it. All she could do was to hold
the sobbing child tight.</p>

<p>It was one of those beautiful days in spring when
everything seems careless and fond. The trees
rustled around them as if hushing the voice of
sorrow. The flowers looked up with bright faces;
the indulgent sunshine shed its broad light. Everything
seemed so much in contrast with the grieving
child that Meg could think of nothing but to set
herself to make that little pale face smile again.
The child used in her happier moments to be fond
of playing a game of shop. Meg excelled in
mimicking the various customers coming to buy.
Taking her ribbon now from her throat she set it
up for sale, and became in turns the querulous
customer, the fat fussy customer, the French cus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>tomer.
As she gesticulated, shaking her fingers
up in the air, shrugging her shoulders, and talking
in French, bargaining, vowing it was <i>trop cher</i>,
she acted her part so vividly that Elsie forgot her
sorrow, and at last broke out into a laugh.</p>

<p>From that day Elsie clung to Meg. The girls
continued to abstain from referring to the incident
of the diamond, and Miss Pinkett was elaborately
kind; but Elsie was reminded of her sin by the
emphasis of absolution around her. She still shrank
from the companionship of other girls. With Meg
alone she was forgetful of the past. The tie between
them was recognized, and during the constitutional
walks of the schoolgirls Elsie was allowed
to leave her place among the younger ones and
walk with her friend. These walks now lay toward
the country, away from the village, where an outbreak
of scarlatina was raging. In the blue-rimmed
land, with its misty embattlement of downs outlined
against the sky, through the shade and flicker
of woods, through lanes sweet with the bravery of
floral walls, the girls walked; and to Elsie Meg
became the mouthpiece of nature. Those walks
in the countryside were at this time the happy
hours of Meg's life. The sensitive little hand in
hers, that responded so quickly to her own delight,
helped the inspiration that came to her from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
illusive cloudland overhead, from wooded aisles,
spread with wild flowers, voiced with notes of birds
and buzz of insects.</p>

<p>This part of Meg's school-life came to an abrupt
conclusion. One morning Elsie did not come down
to breakfast. That evening she had a little fever,
and the child's throat was sore. The doctor came,
and the word "scarlatina" was whispered. In a
few days the school was empty of the girls. Meg
alone remained as usual. Every precaution to prevent
infection was taken by Miss Reeves, and Elsie
was isolated.</p>

<p>A new anxiety now sprang up in Meg's heart.
Her thoughts were ever in the room at the top of
the house, with the heavy curtains drawn before
the door, from which distilled an acrid smell of disinfectants.
Often Meg crept upstairs and listened.
She watched every day for the doctor, to ask how
Elsie was. The answers were always vague. In a
few days the crisis would come. There was a tantalizing
mystery in these replies, always followed
by the injunction not to go near the child.</p>

<p>"Does she ever ask for me?" asked Meg.</p>

<p>"She is delirious, she would not know you," was
the invariable answer.</p>

<p>One morning the news came that the crisis was
past&mdash;delirium was over. The news was good; yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the doctor's face looked grave. Meg overheard
him say to Miss Reeves that Elsie might sink from
weakness. The child's feebleness baffled him.</p>

<p>"When shall I see her?" asked Meg huskily.</p>

<p>"Not just yet," the doctor replied, patting her
head.</p>

<p>That night a storm of wind raged outside. Meg
listened to the howl of the wind, to the lashing of
the trees bending their backs to the scourge. The
doors creaked; Pilot was dragging at his chain.
Meg's thoughts were with Elsie. The contrast of
her feebleness and the force raging outside seemed
to haunt her. She fell asleep, and she dreamed
that Elsie was dead. She saw her distinctly, a white,
piteous figure lying very still, beaten down by some
pitiless assailant who had left her there. Meg
awoke with a start. The storm was over, but Elsie
had called her.</p>

<p>"Meg, Meg, come!"</p>

<p>Was that cry part of her dream? She sat up
rigid, her ears strained, every nerve on the alert,
listening. Through the silence the call came again:</p>

<p>"Meg, Meg, come!"</p>

<p>She could not have told if she heard it with her
physical ears. Elsie wanted her; that was all she
knew. She was out of bed in a moment. A determination
strong as had been that former idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
flight impelled her. She would see her pet. If she
caught the infection and died, what mattered it?
She would go to Elsie, the child wanted her.</p>

<p>A pale light flickered through the space of windows
left uncovered by the shutters. Meg made
her way cautiously, yet swiftly. It seemed to her
that Elsie knew she was coming, and that there was
no time to be lost. A jet of gas was burning low
in the passage at the end of which was the curtained
door. Meg lifted the heavy drapery. The
scent of the carbolic grew more acrid. She pushed
her head through the door that stood slightly ajar.
The nurse, lying on a couch, was asleep. Meg at
first could not see Elsie, but when she made a few
steps inside the room she perceived the child.</p>

<p>Elsie's eyes were turned toward the door, as if
anxiously watching. As Meg entered she made a
little ghostly gesture, as if trying to get up. Meg
was by her bedside in a moment. She had an impression
that it was Elsie and yet not Elsie who
was there. The beautiful hair was all cut off. The
face was shrunk, a distressed expression rumpled
the brow. The eyes were very bright and wide
open. They seemed to Meg Elsie's eyes looking at
her from a distance. As she clasped the child in
her arms she realized with despair that it was like
clasping a small gasping phantom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought you would never come, Meg," Elsie
murmured through her labored breathing.</p>

<p>"Oh, Elsie, I have wanted to come," whispered
Meg, bringing her face close down to the pillow.</p>

<p>"I wanted you," whispered Elsie. "I kept saying,
'Meg, Meg, come!'"</p>

<p>"I heard you," said Meg.</p>

<p>"Heard me?" repeated the muffled voice. "How
could you hear me? I only whispered it. 'Meg
Meg, come!'"</p>

<p>"But I heard you," said Meg, "and here I am,
darling; here I am, and I will never leave you."</p>

<p>"I said," continued Elsie in that labored whisper,
"if Meg comes the dreadful diamond will go."</p>

<p>"The dreadful diamond?" repeated Meg.</p>

<p>"It was always there; and sometimes it grew big,
big, like a shining mountain, and put itself here."
The spectral hand placed itself on the tiny chest.
"It was heavy and cold&mdash;it pressed me down."</p>

<p>"It was a bad dream, my pet; not reality," said
Meg soothingly.</p>

<p>"I saw it always, shining red, blue, and green.
It shone in the dark as in the light, and sometimes
it was like a great bright eye looking at me&mdash;always
looking at me. It moved when I moved, and
seemed to say, 'You nearly had Meg turned away
like a thief.'"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no; it was not you, it was I&mdash;I who did it
all of my own free will," cried Meg, kissing the
cold face that had become the emblem round which
gathered her tenderest emotions.</p>

<p>"But it won't come again, because you have
kissed me. The kiss that is better than the
diamond," said Elsie with a vague relief in her
panting voice.</p>

<p>"It will never come again," repeated Meg, trying
to still her sobs.</p>

<p>Elsie lay back apparently at peace. Suddenly she
turned, and there was a flicker of the old trouble
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you think God, too, forgives me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Meg with a bursting heart.</p>

<p>"Are you sure he does?" insisted the piteous,
laboring voice.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it, I know it!" said Meg with a
world of conviction.</p>

<p>Elsie sighed, closed her eyes, and there was a
silence. Meg thought she was asleep, when she
opened her eyes again and looked round with a
troubled movement.</p>

<p>"It is very dark," she said. "Draw back the
curtains and let in the light."</p>

<p>"It is not day yet," said Meg.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stay with me, it is so dark," gasped Elsie, her
hands restlessly moving as if pushing back some
weight.</p>

<p>"I will not stir from your side, my pet," said
Meg, stilling her sobs.</p>

<p>The gray light was stealing in. The tired nurse
still slept. Meg saw the remote expression in the
sick child's eyes growing more remote.</p>

<p>Suddenly Elsie made another ghostly attempt to
sit up.</p>

<p>"How sweet the lilac smells!" she said. "Here
is London-pride, and there's thrift. I'll pluck these
for Mamey."</p>

<p>She struggled to get out of bed, while Meg held
her tight.</p>

<p>"Mamey calls to me&mdash;to&mdash;say&mdash;good-night&mdash;and
say my prayers," she panted, and then dropped
back.</p>

<p>The blue lips moved as if speaking; but Meg
could not distinguish the words. A realization that
the child was slipping away, that phantoms were
about her as she stood on the threshold of the
other world, came upon Meg with an anguish of
awe.</p>

<p>"Our Father," she began softly, impelled to pray;
but Elsie seemed to pay no heed. The little hands
still stirred uneasily. The lips still moved. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
last Meg distinguished some broken words: "Forgive
us our trespasses&mdash;as&mdash;as&mdash;Meg forgives."
There came a sigh, the lips stopped muttering, and
only the waxen image of what had been Elsie lay
on the bed.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>WHO IS HE?</h3>


<p>Five years had elapsed. Meg was eighteen; she
had distanced all her competitors, and she was the
head-pupil of Miss Reeves' establishment.</p>

<p>During those years she still remained somewhat
of a solitary in the school. The girls who had been
her first schoolfellows had all left. By the succeeding
girls, Meg was still called repellent by some,
attractive by others.</p>

<p>As time went on the mystery of her origin, about
which her schoolmates still busied themselves,
pained and humiliated her with greater poignancy.
She longed to be allowed to know and love her
benefactor. When questioned as to who she thought
she was&mdash;how she had come by the name of Beecham&mdash;she
felt inclined to answer bitterly: "Do not call
me by my name. It would be more convenient to
call me by a number, as I am told the prisoners are
called. Let me say I am number 18 or 24."</p>

<p>Mr. Standish still held an ever-present if some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>what
dim place in the background of Meg's consciousness.
It was a quaint half-goblin remembrance.
The link between them seemed sundered
forever. She had never heard from him since their
parting. To Ursula alone she had spoken of that
solitary time, of the friend who had been kind to
her, and of the fashion-plate which had been sacred
to her as her mother's portrait. To her alone she
had shown her treasured presents. One day Ursula
suggested that her mysterious protector was Mr.
Standish. That the stern old gentleman was perhaps
a guardian appointed by this friend in his
absence. Meg had disclaimed the possibility. Yet
the thought that he might be lingered in her mind.
As a child loves wonderland, so she dwelt upon
Ursula's suggestion. She reasoned herself out of it.
She laughed at it, yet it remained. Was he not the
only one who had cared for her in her unsheltered
childhood?</p>

<p>"Describe him to me," Ursula had once asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot," Meg answered. "It is strange. I
can remember a tie he wore&mdash;dark-blue, dotted over
with tiny horseshoes; and I remember a pair of
slippers he had, with big red roses on the toes. I
remember his hands, and the color of his hair."</p>

<p>"And you can't remember his face?" Ursula said
in tones of disappointment.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps if I saw him I might," answered Meg
reflectively. "It is so long ago, I have a very dim
recollection of his features. They beamed with
kindness, and he was kind to me." And then she
would tell again the many kind things he had done,
the memory of which she held sacred. "Ah," she
continued, "I used to be unable to think and speak
of those things without tears, but now you see my
eyes are quite dry."</p>

<p>Once Meg asked Mr. Fullbloom if Mr. Standish
was her guardian. The elderly lawyer she had once
known was dead. His brother was now the representative
of her unknown benefactor. He alone
visited her from the outside world. The solicitor
chuckled, as if he were amazingly tickled by this
question, but he answered it neither in the affirmative
nor the negative.</p>

<p>Mr. Horace Fullbloom was cheery and gray-headed;
his sparkling brown eyes were surrounded
by crinkles, suggestive of puckers made by laughter
rather than by age. His appearance suggested a
mischievous humor. Like his brother, he was a bit
of a dandy. He also wore a frilled shirt, an impressive
bloodstone ring on his little finger, and he
sported a silver snuffbox. The solicitor was a
favorite with the girls. His cynicism was the sunshine
of cynicism. He chaffed them with paternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
familiarity, watching them with amused benevolence.
He seemed to regard them as belonging to
a species not deserving any serious thought or treatment.
Meg especially interested him. He always
questioned her kindly about herself, and apparently
relished the little tiffs that marked their intercourse.</p>

<p>These tiffs were caused by Meg's endeavors to
find out the name of her mysterious benefactor, and
by the humorous banter with which the solicitor
evaded her curiosity. She had dreams of that
human providence who stood between her and
destitution. Every noble personality she heard or
read of became associated in Meg's mind with the
thought of her guardian hero. The banter with
which Mr. Fullbloom met her inquiries did not
prevent Meg from waiting and watching for the
feverish moment when she would again question
him. Was it the stern old gentleman she remembered
who twice had appeared to her? If it were,
what was his name? If it were not, who was it,
then?</p>

<p>To the teasing humor with which the solicitor
asked her why she wanted so much to know, she
answered, "Because I am grateful."</p>

<p>"But gratitude, my dear," said Mr. Fullbloom,
tapping his snuffbox, "wants an object. Suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
I were to tell you it was the big stone figure on
the gate, or some old parchment will and testament
that is your guardian. What then? Would you
feel grateful to those bloodless patrons?"</p>

<p>"I would be grateful to one who remembered and
thought of me were he living or dead," said Meg.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if he be alive he is a gruff, disagreeable
old curmudgeon; you might be afraid of him&mdash;you
might not like him!"</p>

<p>Meg was not to be baffled by such answers. She
wanted to know who it was she had a right to love
and be grateful to. It was such pain to her also
to live among people who kept wondering who
she was.</p>

<p>More than once she put into the solicitor's hands
a letter, that she asked him to deliver to her
unknown friend; but to these missives, that he
invariably took away with him, Mr. Fullbloom
never brought an answer. To her demand, had he
delivered her letters, Mr. Fullbloom returned tantalizing
answers. One day he admitted that he had
put them all, every one, into the pillar post.</p>

<p>"But not as they were, without an address?"
Meg asked in consternation.</p>

<p>"That was no concern of mine. I posted them,"
said Mr. Fullbloom.</p>

<p>"But where did my letters go?" she cried.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps one went to Surrey; perhaps another
found its way to York Minster; perhaps a third
was carried by fate to its rightful owner," the
solicitor replied with a chuckle, and eyes twinkling
with the light of mischief. With a little burst of
anger, Meg told him that if he would not tell her
who her protector was she would rather not see
him; it was so painful not to know to whom she
owed all this gratitude.</p>

<p>After this scene a long interval elapsed, during
which Mr. Fullbloom did not appear; till inconsistently
Meg began to long for him to come and
visit her again.</p>

<p>It was the eve of the Easter holidays. The school
was breaking up. Meg had formed a resolution.
This resolution helped her to bear the pain that
always accompanied the approach of the holidays.
The eager plans she heard her comrades discussing
were ever an occasion of pain to her sensitive
nature, bringing her loneliness home more keenly.</p>

<p>The gentle independence that now marked Meg's
manner had grown upon her of late; the stern
necessity of self-support that, since her childhood,
had governed her thoughts and actions, had become
the ruling instinct of her life. She had determined
to be no longer a burden to her protector, and the
resolve heightened her spirits. Dreaming is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
employment of the idle, and Meg's life was one of
action.</p>

<p>If something of the vividness that had distinguished
her glance and expression in childhood
seemed to have passed away, it was rather subdued
or merged in a look, as of a habit of thought now
usual to her. Meg's appearance was a matter of
discussion in the school; some called her beautiful,
others vowed she was plain. Her soft, silky "no
color" hair&mdash;"mousey hair" Ursula called it&mdash;went
charmingly with her complexion; it obtruded somewhat
heavily over her forehead, for she was
inclined to be careless about her dress. Her beauty
was of the sort that you do not think of analyzing.
It grew upon the beholder, who invariably discovered
that her features possessed beauty of form,
and that the whole physiognomy had the charm
that is magnetic.</p>

<p>Meg had been contemplating writing to Mr. Fullbloom
to tell him the resolve she had taken, when
his presence was announced in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said the solicitor, taking her
two hands in his, "here I am. I did not dare to
show myself before I could communicate news.
You commanded me the last time I saw you not to
appear in your presence until I brought you tidings
of your guardian."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was sorry I said that," replied Meg. "I have
missed you. I did not think you would obey
me so implicitly."</p>

<p>"Not after such a definite command!" Eh? exclaimed
the solicitor, jerking his head on one side
and surveying her with his superficially smiling
glance. "Well, now, what news of yourself, little
lady?" he continued, leading her to a chair and
sitting down beside her.</p>

<p>"I have passed my examination," said Meg. "I
am now at the head of the school."</p>

<p>Mr. Fullbloom put his hand on his heart and
bowed.</p>

<p>"A modern Aspasia!" he replied as Meg paused,
and seemed to hesitate. "Come," he went on,
"when is our tiff to begin? I must have my tiff
about the great Unknown."</p>

<p>"No," said Meg gently, "we shall have no more
tiffs. I have made up my mind I will ask no more
questions; and if possible, I shall cease wondering
concerning myself. Whoever my benefactor
may be, I am grateful to him&mdash;grateful from my
heart. I wish I could prove my gratitude to him.
I wish it so much that I cannot but think it will be
granted to me to do so some day."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will&mdash;and sooner than you think,"
exclaimed Mr. Fullbloom. "Ha! ha!" he went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
tantalizingly, the flicker of mischief alight in his
eyes as Meg looked up inquiringly. "You have
just been saying you would not wonder any
more.</p>

<p>"You would not be curious. Ha! ha! Mrs. Blue
Beard, you would pry into any forbidden
closet&mdash;you know you would&mdash;to find out that
secret."</p>

<p>"No," repeated Meg, "I will not be curious any
more. There must be some reason&mdash;some reason
that I ought to respect. You will, I know, tell my
kind friend, who he or she may be, that I am grateful;
also, that I have taken a great resolve."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Fullbloom with evident enjoyment.
"May I ask what it is?"</p>

<p>"I will not be dependent any longer. I am going
to earn my own livelihood," replied Meg.</p>

<p>"How valorous we are, all of a sudden!" said
Mr. Fullbloom, chuckling as if immensely tickled
by the idea of Meg earning her livelihood.</p>

<p>"No, not all of a sudden!" said Meg with energy.
"I have long thought of it. My wishes, my dreams
have long been to be independent; to be no longer
a pensioner on the bounty of one whose very name
is unknown to me. I am going to be a governess.
Miss Reeves has heard of a situation, the duties of
which she thinks I am fitted to undertake&mdash;to teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
three little girls in the country. The salary is
thirty pounds. I won't be dependent any longer,"
repeated Meg with concentration.</p>

<p>"Miss Reeves and the three little girls go to
Jericho!" cried Mr. Fullbloom. Then taking Meg's
two hands in his paternal grasp, "My dear child,"
he said, "you have long wished to know your benefactor's
name. To-morrow you will know it. You
will not only know it, but you will be on a visit to
him. He sends me to invite you down to stay at
his place in the country."</p>

<p>"To-morrow!" repeated Meg. "On a visit to
him! Who, then, is he?"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" cried Mr. Fullbloom gleefully. "All
that fine assumption of having laid curiosity aside,
where is it? No, no, no; not till to-morrow will
you know anything about it."</p>

<p>"But where am I to go? Who am I to ask for?"
cried Meg.</p>

<p>"Listen, my dear," explained Mr. Fullbloom, giving
an occasional emphasis to his words by a
pressure of Meg's hands. "You are to go to London
first, then to the station of the North-Western
Railway. Miss Reeves will go with you thus far;
she will take a first-class ticket for you. You must
take the train that leaves London at a quarter to
three. I will be at Greywolds Station to meet you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
at half-past five. It takes over three hours to get
to Greywolds."</p>

<p>Meg felt a sudden recoil as she realized how near
she was to the meeting she had dreamed of so long.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble your little head about money.
All that is settled. Miss Reeves will make the
necessary preparations. You have nothing to do
but attend to the farewells. I must be off now. I
am going to Greywolds to-night. I have an appointment
with your mysterious patron."</p>

<p>Mr. Fullbloom's eyes were brimming over with
elvish laughter, as with another pressure of Meg's
two hands he turned away. He left her standing
silent and chill, under the impression of that sudden
revulsion of feeling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>ARRIVAL.</h3>


<p>Past stretches of meadowland and woodland,
past undulating fields sleeping peacefully in the
sunshine, past busy towns and reposeful hamlets
sped the train bearing Meg to her unknown guardian's
home. The solitude of the empty carriage
oppressed her. The flurry of the farewells and the
pain of sundered associations increased the timidity
of her spirit, as she realized more vividly that she
was hurrying she knew not whither to meet she
knew not whom.</p>

<p>Meg had not yet recovered from the recoil she
had experienced on hearing that she was so soon to
meet her mysterious benefactor. As every moment
lengthened the space that parted her from surroundings
which, if not altogether sympathetic, had
yet the sweetness of familiarity, the unknown future
presented itself to her invested with a touch of fear.
She combated this mood. Was she not hastening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
toward the human being who had shown solicitude
toward her in her forlornness?</p>

<p>She felt almost sure that her protector would
prove to be the stern stranger whom she had twice
seen in her childhood, and yet there would drift up
to her mind the possibility that Mr. Standish might
turn out to be this unknown friend.</p>

<p>"I hope not," Meg said to herself, sudden shame
overcoming her at the possibility of meeting so
soon, and of owing so much to one upon whose personality
her thoughts had dwelt so long. "I was
a foolish sprite of a child when I cared for him.
I am a young woman now," she murmured.</p>

<p>When she stepped out on the platform of the
wayside station of Greywolds she looked about.
Mr. Fullbloom was not there. No one appeared to
be waiting for her. A farmer's cart and a private
carriage were drawn up on the other side of the
paling that separated the country station from the
roadside. The single passenger who had alighted
besides herself from the train got into the carriage
and drove off; the cart after depositing a load of
metal casks jogged away. Meg felt bewildered.
If Mr. Fullbloom did not come for her, what was
she to do? She had no money with which to pay
her fare back. She did not know the name of the
place to which to direct the porter to take her lug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>gage
after she had identified her modest trunk.
The old sense of isolation so familiar to her in her
schooldays paralyzed Meg, and her eyelids smarted,
as if she were about to cry.</p>

<p>Suddenly a carriage drove up, the gate of the
station was pushed open, and the dandified figure
of Mr. Fullbloom came gayly forward.</p>

<p>"So, you have found your way," he said airily.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you had forgotten your appointment,"
Meg answered with dignity.</p>

<p>"I always associate this train and ladies with
unpunctuality," the solicitor replied with unruffled
equanimity.</p>

<p>Offering Meg his arm he led her out. Nervousness
conquered every other feeling, even curiosity. She
asked no questions as she perceived a carriage with
two horses and liveried servants awaiting her. She
stepped inside, sank back into the cushioned seat,
with Mr. Fullbloom by her side. As she felt herself
bowled along she gave a little gasp.</p>

<p>The solicitor was very chatty. He inquired after
her journey. He asked details of the parting with
schoolfellows. He pointed out pretty bits in the
landscape. Meg could not follow what he said;
a longing for silence was upon her. She wished
with all her heart her companion would hold his
tongue and let her think and realize.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently the carriage drove through gates,
thrown open to let it pass in. The way lay under
an avenue of trees. A park stretched to right and
left. As Meg looked round she felt sure this stately
domain could not belong to William Standish.</p>

<p>"This is Greywolds Manor," said Mr. Fullbloom
with a chuckle, pointing to a solid gray pile flanked
with turrets at either end. "What do you think
of your new home?"</p>

<p>Meg did not answer. Now that she knew for
certain it was not the friend of her childhood who
would welcome her when she alighted she was
aware of an inconsistent disappointment. There
came a sudden chill in the air. The owner of this
lordly place would not understand her. Everything
seemed gigantic, repellent. The trees threw too
much shadow, the sunshine was too bright, the
massive house too large for homeliness.</p>

<p>"Sir Malcolm Loftdale is the proprietor of this
place. Now the mystery is out. You know the
name of your benefactor," chuckled Mr. Fullbloom,
the signals of mischievous enjoyment alight in
his eyes.</p>

<p>The carriage had drawn up before the door of
the mansion. Meg descended; she was aware of a
discreet-looking elderly man helping to gather
together her loose traps, of a respectable-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
dame in an impressive black silk gown coming
forward to meet her.</p>

<p>"This is Mrs. Jarvis, Sir Malcolm's trusty housekeeper.
I cannot leave you in better hands. Good-by,
my dear," said Mr. Fullbloom. Kissing his
finger tips and spreading them in the air, he disappeared
through a side door.</p>

<p>Meg followed the housekeeper up a softly-carpeted
staircase, fragrant with the perfume of
flowers. She was vaguely aware of statues in
niches, of limpid pictures dreaming on the walls.
A knight of old entering an enchanted castle could
not have felt more strange and bewildered, or could
not have summoned more desperate courage than
did Meg as she moved up that grand staircase.</p>

<p>She was ushered into a pretty bedroom, hexagon
shaped. Through the windows looking out on the
park at different angles poured the mellow light of
the late afternoon. Meg, at the request of a trim
maid in a dark gown and dainty muslin cap and
apron, gave up the key of her trunk, painfully realizing
as she did so the slenderness and shabbiness of
the wardrobe that would be exposed to this smart
young woman's gaze. With brusque shyness she
answered the housekeeper's bland expressions of
hospitality and exhortations to rest. In a trice the
deft-handed, nimble-footed attendant had disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of the modest stock of wearing apparel in wardrobes
and drawers, and arranged on the tables the
books, desk, and cheap knickknacks&mdash;parting presents
from some of Meg's school friends; after
which she disappeared with the housekeeper, to
return after a few moments carrying a delicate
porcelain and silver five o'clock solitaire tea-service,
which she deposited on a table by Meg's side.
Then the trim attendant, in tones as respectful as
if Meg's belongings had revealed her to be a duchess,
asked if she could do anything more for Miss
Beecham. On receiving a timorous negative she
announced that dinner was served at seven-thirty;
that the dressing bell would sound at seven. Could
she help Miss Beecham to dress? "No, thank you,"
replied Meg hastily; "I am accustomed to dress
myself."</p>

<p>With a sense of relief Meg heard the door close,
and reflected that probably until dinner-time she
would be left alone.</p>

<p>She poured herself out a cup of tea and looked
round the room. It was a charming little chamber.
Its shape showed that it was placed in a tower. On
all sides she was surrounded by sky and trees.
After awhile she set about making a journey of discovery.
One of the windows was over the mantelpiece;
she tried to find how the flue of the chimney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
went to allow of this quaint arrangement. A bookcase
stood in a corner; its shelves held a delightful
selection of books. A water-color drawing representing
a stormy sea, another of a peaceful and
Arcadian scene, hung on the walls. Two miniatures&mdash;one
of Queen Elizabeth in an immense ruffle,
another of Mary, Queen of Scots&mdash;adorned a recess.
The bed was large, with two pillows; the coverlid
and hangings, of delicate sea-blue damask, matched
the curtains at the windows. An electric bell was
placed near the bed. Meg thought it was the prettiest,
coziest little chamber she had ever seen, and
her spirits rose.</p>

<p>She was still in a kind of half reverie when the
gong sounded, and looking at the clock, she perceived
that the short hand pointed to seven.</p>

<p>Taking out her white muslin gown, Meg began to
array herself with care. She had never devoted
much thought to her toilet before, but she was eager
to please her benefactor. She coiled her brown
hair smoothly round her head, and fastened a red
rose in her bodice. Then she waited till the gong
sounded again.</p>

<p>Timidity once more overcame her as she descended
the grand staircase; realizing at every step
more keenly that the moment had come when she
would be ushered into the presence of her benefac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>tor.
Two footmen in plush and gold lace stood on
either side of an open door; this was the room in
which her host awaited her.</p>

<p>Meg paused on the threshold. A somewhat short
elderly man in evening dress stood near the table.
This was no familiar figure; but she remained
where she was, overwhelmed with emotion, looking
dumbly at this protector of her forlorn youth. She
could not speak for her beating heart. Her shyness
was enhanced by the silence of her host. He
did not advance to greet her; he did not stretch out
a hand of welcome. He stood close to a chair in a
somewhat deferential attitude. Then suddenly Meg
recognized him to be the butler who had received
her in the hall on her arrival. She had not identified
him in her fright.</p>

<p>With a painful sense of the absurdity of her mistake
she took the seat he placed for her and looked
hurriedly round the table. The flower and fruit-decked
expanse, the white cloth, the plate and delicate
glass, glowed rosily under the crimson-shaded
suspension lamp; no second cover was laid, no other
chairs near the board. She was to dine alone.</p>

<p>Meg had scarcely realized this when a plateful of
soup was placed before her, and she felt the two
magnificent lackeys standing on either side of
her chair, watching as she dipped the spoon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
raised it to her lips. The thought that she was to
eat her dinner under the inspection of this frigid
and observant gaze struck her with palsied nervousness.
She upset a tumbler as she stretched her
hand for the salt-cellar; she helped herself to everything
that was offered to her by her attendants;
she allowed the butler without protest to fill the
glasses at her side with claret, hock, and champagne,
and let the beverages stand there untasted.
In the awful silence she started when the door
opened. After awhile the tension of her nervousness
was relieved by a freakish fancy. What a
good story it would make to tell the girls in the
dormitory! How she had sat in a skimpy muslin
dress in this splendid room, hung round with family
portraits which seemed to be watching her; of the
sumptuous repast served to her alone; of the
obsequiousness of the servant men; how terrified
she had been; with what clumsiness she had behaved,
and with what attempts at dignity!</p>

<p>There came a moment at last when, every trace
of heavier diet having been removed, the servants
retired, after having placed the dessert and three
decanters of wine before Meg. She drew a breath
of relief as she made sure that she was alone. A
girlish love of fruit came over her, and she helped
herself to a bunch of grapes. She remembered she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
had once heard the story of a girl who for a day
had been mistaken for a queen. The people cheered
her, the courtiers obeyed her slightest wish. Meg
smiled as she thought this girl must have felt as
she felt to-night.</p>

<p>She glanced around as she ate her grapes. The
table made a patch of brilliancy in the long room,
the corners of which remained dusky. Gleaming
frames caught the light of the suspension lamp, and
here and there revealed the superb apparel of the
dignified full-length men and women gazing down
upon her from the walls. As Meg's eyes traveled
slowly round this stately company she was vaguely
revolving in her mind how she would summon up
courage to leave this room and make her way back
to her own.</p>

<p>Presently her eyes rested on what looked like a
blank framed space at the furthest end of the apartment.
She could not distinguish the cause of this
effect. It puzzled her, so she rose from her chair
and drew nearer. She found it was a picture with
its face turned to the wall.</p>

<p>The discovery affected her like the touch of a
spectral hand. That disgraced canvas riveted her
attention. What did it mean? She looked away;
but the spell continued to work, and once more she
drew near. The sight of its disgrace brought a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
piteous feeling. It looked like an outcast in the
midst of this painted pageantry of splendid men
and women.</p>

<p>Whose face was it thus turned away? Was it
that of a man or of a woman? Meg felt as if she
would give anything to know. Everything else
faded in interest near the story of that picture.
She tried vainly to discover a trace of revealing
outline. The fascination grew too strong. She
got up on a chair and tried with all her strength
to turn the picture round and get a glimpse. She
had succeeded in moving it slightly when she heard
behind her the door open.</p>

<p>Meg dropped her hold of the frame and turned
round.</p>

<p>The housekeeper was standing on the threshold
looking at her aghast.</p>

<p>"Miss Beecham, what are you doing?"</p>

<p>"I was trying to get a peep at this picture," said
Meg, jumping down. "Why is its face turned to
the wall?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Jarvis shook her head. "Why, miss, it
would be worth a servant's place in this house to
turn that picture round. Sir Malcolm Loftdale has
forbidden the name of the person whose portrait
that is to be mentioned. He never comes into this
room. I am sure it is because of that picture."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed; I am sorry," said Meg in some confusion.</p>

<p>"I could tell you all about that picture, Miss
Beecham. I have been in this house these thirty
years, and I was there the day it was turned to the
wall. It was a day I'll never forget&mdash;not so long
as I live; but it's laid upon me not to tell," went on
the housekeeper, who looked packed with mystery.</p>

<p>"Do not think I would wish you to tell me," exclaimed
Meg hurriedly. "I would not&mdash;not on any
account." Then she asked with abrupt transition:
"Shall I see Sir Malcolm Loftdale to-night?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Beecham, not to-night. Sir Malcolm
sent me down to ask you to excuse him. He is old,
miss, and not strong. He hopes that you will forgive
his not welcoming you himself, and that you
will make yourself at home."</p>

<p>"Thank Sir Malcolm Loftdale for me, and say
that I feel very grateful to him for his hospitality,"
Meg replied, relieved yet vaguely nettled by her
host's neglect.</p>

<p>"Coffee is served in the drawing-room, Miss
Beecham."</p>

<p>"Thank you; but I think I shall return to my
room," said Meg.</p>

<p>She hurried up the staircase. A confused pain
seemed to haunt the surrounding splendor. It op<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>pressed
her as might the scent of flowers in a room
of death.</p>

<p>When she opened the door of her pretty room,
the sea-green silk curtains of which had been drawn,
the daintiness and comfort contrasted pleasantly
with the alien magnificence outside, saddened as it
was by a jarring note of brooding grief. A black
cat had found its way in, and came forward to meet
Meg with tail uplifted and a welcoming purr. The
homeliness of the scene revived her drooping spirits.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>SIR MALCOLM LOFTDALE.</h3>


<p>Meg had more than once explored the house and
the grounds. She had performed the pilgrimage
under the expansive wing of Mrs. Jarvis; she had
wandered alone over the mansion and rambled
through the park, feeling delight in the old-world
charm of the place. The touch of tragic mystery
brought into the atmosphere by the picture on
which a ban had been laid now added to the spell
of its fascination. The lofty rooms, with somber
gilt or painted ceilings; the faded tapestries and
brocaded hangings; the dusky tones of the furniture,
upon which the sunbeams fell with an antique
glow, appeared to her steeped in the mystery of
associations. Every room seemed a chapter in an
unknown story, the thought of which kindled her
fancy. The park, with its lengthening vistas, its
sylvan retreats, and patriarchal trees, a branch of
the silver river sweeping through its stately alleys;
the stretches of lawns, the flower-gardens, the glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
structures in which bloomed a tropical vegetation,
enchanted her.</p>

<p>It was like living in a picture, she thought, to
live amid such peaceful, beautiful, finely ordered
surroundings, whose past haunted them like a
presence. After the crude and noisy bustle of
immature possibilities to which she was accustomed,
the wearied splendors of this domain came to
her as a revelation of novel possibilities in the
setting of life.</p>

<p>A week had elapsed, Meg had almost grown
accustomed to the place, and yet she had not seen
its owner. She had at first begun every morning
by asking Mrs. Jarvis if there was a probability of
her seeing Sir Malcolm Loftdale during the course
of the day, but the housekeeper on each occasion
had given an evasive answer, and Meg now asked
no more. She might have felt wounded at this
breach of hospitality had not the behavior of the
servants precluded all idea of a slight being offered
to her. They paid her obsequious attention, they
obeyed her slightest expressed wish. She might
have imagined herself the queen of the domain.
The solitude, the homage paid to her, the regard for
her comfort, reminded her of a fairy tale where the
host remains unseen and the heroine lives in
splendor and isolation. She wondered often why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
her benefactor kept himself thus sternly secluded.
She began to think it could not be the old gentleman
she had seen in her childhood; why should he
avoid her? If it were a stranger was it because of
some unsightly physical affliction, some form of
mental derangement? was it a brooding melancholy
that caused him morbidly to shrink from contact
with outsiders? A longing to be of comfort
mingled with the curiosity she felt concerning her
mysterious host.</p>

<p>One late afternoon as she rambled in the park she
saw, framed in by trees as in a picture, the figure of
a tall, slender, white-haired gentleman walking
toward her. She recognized him at once. It was
the mysterious stranger, twice met in her childhood.
He held his head high. What a head it was!
There was an eagle cast of physiognomy, a chill
expression in the eyes, a hardness on the lips. He
wore a country suit and carried a heavy gold-headed
stick; a diamond stud on a jeweled seal caught the
light and shone. These little details curiously
impressed themselves upon Meg. She stopped,
asking herself if this was the master of the house?</p>

<p>The stranger glanced toward her, lifted his hat,
and with an old-world salute passed on. Meg
determined not to look after him; but she could not
resist the temptation, and turning round she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
him ascending the steps of the house. On questioning
the housekeeper, Meg found that the picturesque
old gentleman was Sir Malcolm Loftdale.</p>

<p>Next morning Meg was standing arranging some
flowers in the window of the little room she had
chosen for her morning retreat&mdash;it looked out on a
pleasant side alley of the grounds in the center of
which stood a sun dial&mdash;when the door suddenly
opened, and the gentleman she had seen in the park
on the previous evening entered unannounced. He
did not advance beyond the threshold, but he closed
the door after him and kept one hand on the
handle. He did not extend the other in greeting.</p>

<p>At sight of him Meg's heart fluttered, and she
acknowledged by a flurried inclination of her head
his stately bow.</p>

<p>He was handsomer than she had imagined him to
be; but the light of his stern blue eye remained
cold, and there was a remoteness in the steady
glance that he fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"I beg you, Miss Beecham, to excuse me for not
having welcomed you before," he said in a voice of
cold courtesy. "I trust you will forgive me for
exercising a privilege age is apt freely to indulge
near youth&mdash;that of following the usual routine of
life. I am a solitary, my life is organized for loneliness."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have been most kind, sir," muttered Meg,
in a tumult of timidity.</p>

<p>"My servants have received strict orders to
attend to your comfort. I hope they have been
attentive?"</p>

<p>"They have been very attentive," replied Meg.</p>

<p>"I fear the days may seem to drag heavily for
you, Miss Beecham," the old gentleman resumed,
without a shadow of softening in the coldness of
his voice or the scrutiny of his glance. "I have
thought&mdash;to relieve their tedium&mdash;that you might
like a horse. I will have one broken for your use.
There are pretty rides about."</p>

<p>"I do not know how to ride, sir," said Meg,
touched and bewildered by the thoughtfulness and
repellent manner of her host.</p>

<p>"My old groom would teach you; he is a most
trustworthy and respectable man," said Sir
Malcolm.</p>

<p>"Thank you sir," said Meg. Then with desperate
courage, as her benefactor seemed about to retire,
she added breathlessly: "I should not feel lonely,
sir&mdash;not&mdash;if you would let me be with you a little&mdash;if
you would let me read for you, or do something
for you. You have been so good to me all those
years."</p>

<p>The old gentleman bowed hastily; the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of his cold glance seemed to grow colder as he
replied: "I assure you, Miss Beecham, you need
feel yourself under no obligation to me for what I
have done. It is very little."</p>

<p>"Little! It was everything to me!" said Meg
hurriedly, her voice trembling with restrained emotion.
"You twice saved me from a wretched fate.
But for you, sir, as you told me on that evening you
took me back to school, I would have been as uncared
for as a workhouse child."</p>

<p>"I wish, if you will allow me distinctly to state
my wishes, that allusion to the past be dropped
between us. I can repeat only that you are under
no obligation," replied her host, his thin lips remaining
tense in their cruel firmness of line, his glance
courteously repellent. "When the case was pointed
out to me it became my plain duty to do what I
did."</p>

<p>"I do not understand; I only know that if you
had not been good to me I should have been ignorant
and homeless," answered Meg with reckless
iteration.</p>

<p>There was a pause, Sir Malcolm frowned, then he
said with the same impassible frigidity:</p>

<p>"If you choose, Miss Beecham, to consider that
you are under a debt of gratitude to me, allow me
to say that you will express it in the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
most agreeable to me by never referring to the
subject."</p>

<p>Bowing once more with that impassible fineness
of mien, the old gentleman opened the door and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Meg felt crushed as by some physical blow. The
gratitude that she had harbored in her heart till it
was filled to bursting all those years was thrown
back upon it, and the pain stifled her. She realized
her loneliness as she never had realized it before.
She wandered blindly out into the park, and for the
first time, in the heart of nature, she felt like an
outcast. She rebelled against the isolation to which
her benefactor would condemn her. It felt like an
insult.</p>

<p>To be grateful to those who are good to us
is a sacred right. He had no authority to take
from her this God-given privilege. After awhile
she grew calmer, but a melancholy fell over her
such as she had never known.</p>

<p>Day succeeded day, and the intercourse between
Meg and her host remained but little changed. She
watched him curiously whenever she had the opportunity.
She came to know his habits. A young
man was closeted with him for some hours every
morning. Mrs. Jarvis told Meg he was Sir Malcolm's
secretary, and read the papers to him, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
baronet's eyesight was beginning to fail. He had
lodgings in the village.</p>

<p>Sir Malcolm rode out alone, walked alone, took
his meals alone, spent his evenings alone. Occasionally
some elderly country squires called at the
house; but there was apparently no intimacy between
the baronet and his neighbors. Meg often
watched her host wandering about the park; there
was an alley he haunted. As he paced backward
and forward, his hands behind his back, his tall
figure, slender almost to gauntness, clothed in the
somewhat old-fashioned costume he affected, his
white hair shining like spun glass about his pale,
high-featured face, she thought he looked like a
ghost which had stepped down out of one of the
pictures. Little by little she grew to feel an intense
interest in that stately specter.</p>

<p>Whenever they met Sir Malcolm was courteous
and cold. Sometimes he passed her by with that
old-world salute; oftener he stopped to inquire
after her comfort, to offer with distant interest
suggestions for her amusement. He recommended
her books to read; he once pointed out to her the
parts of the house to which historical interest was
attached.</p>

<p>He attracted and repelled Meg. She was always
in a fright when she was near him. His glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
withered every impulse to pass the distance he
imposed between them. A chill air seemed around
him, as might be round an iceberg. The look of
power on his face, the suggestion his appearance
gave of a strong, self-contained personality, possessed
for her the same sort of fascination as the
flash and iridescence of an iceberg that will not
melt. The interest Meg felt for her host kept pace
with her fear. She always connected that picture
turned to the wall with his history and his character.
There it was always in presence, and yet
under apparently some black disgrace.</p>

<p>Away from Sir Malcolm, she would indulge a
zeal to win his regard, to conquer it. Watching
his solitary pacings to and fro, a pity would fill her
heart for the lonely man who had been so good to
her. In his presence came the chill, checking
every expression of emotion. Sometimes when she
met his glance she fancied her benefactor disliked
her.</p>

<p>The sadness deepened upon Meg&mdash;the sadness of
a sensitive nature condemned to isolation. The inaction
of her days wearied her. She looked back
with a touch of nostalgia on the busy schooldays,
and mourned anew for Elsie, who had allowed her
to give love. Meg's pride also rebelled against
eating the bread of idleness under her benefactor's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
roof: that gentle independence had grown a sort of
second nature with her.</p>

<p>One morning she was aware of a certain flurry
through the house. Mrs. Jarvis told her that Sir
Malcolm's secretary had been called away suddenly
to London on important family business, and
that the master was left with his papers alone.</p>

<p>Meg received the information in silence. For a
few moments after the housekeeper left she stood
still, thinking. Once or twice she walked to the
room and came back irresolute. She at last went
determinedly out of the room and made her way to
the library, where Sir Malcolm spent the greater
part of his time indoors.</p>

<p>She knocked, but scarcely waited for permission
to open the door. Walking swiftly in before he
could recognize her, she stood by Sir Malcolm's
chair.</p>

<p>"I have come to ask if I may read to you, sir, in
the absence of Mr. Robinson?" she said in the
smooth, quick voice of mastered timidity.</p>

<p>He looked up surprised, and rose.</p>

<p>"I could not accept it of you," he said with a
bow.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked with breathless gentleness.</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. Jarvis suggest to you to come?" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
said with a quick frown, an evidence of irritation
he suppressed at once.</p>

<p>"No," said Meg. "I heard Mr. Robinson had
left, and I hoped that you would let me take his
place."</p>

<p>"That would be impossible. I would not lay
such a tax upon any lady," he said with courteous
definiteness of accent and manner.</p>

<p>"Why will you not let me read to you?" asked
Meg pleadingly.</p>

<p>"Because," he answered, with an attempt at
lightness of tone that did not yet take from its distance
and firmness, "young ladies do not care for
politics, and politics alone interest me."</p>

<p>"They would interest me if I read them for you,"
said Meg with timid persistence.</p>

<p>"Allow me to beg you to put into the balance
against this plea the argument that it would be disagreeable
to me," Sir Malcolm replied, with a
directness the brutality of which was veiled by the
stately tone of dismissal in his voice and manner.
"And the spirit that impelled you to undertake the
task would make it all the more painful."</p>

<p>As Meg did not answer he continued:</p>

<p>"Excuse the frankness of my refusal. I thank
you, nevertheless, for the offer."</p>

<p>He glanced toward the door, and as she moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
away he advanced to open it for her; but Meg paused
on her way. Her spirit was up; the fear that hitherto
had quelled her before him fell from her. She
had grown suddenly irritated at his invincible coldness.
She would expose herself to no more rebuffs.</p>

<p>"May I ask you, sir, to be so kind as to spare me
a moment? I have a request to make."</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied, turning back; he sat
down and pointed to a chair near his. But Meg
remained standing.</p>

<p>Embarrassment, resolution kept her motionless
with a touch of angular rigidity in her pose. Her
voice, unsteady at first, grew more controlled as she
went on:</p>

<p>"Before leaving school I had an offer of a situation
as governess to three young children. You
were kind enough, sir, to ask me on a visit. I thank
you for the hospitality you have shown me. I
think my visit must now come to an end. With
your permission I shall inquire if the place is still
vacant, and take it if it be."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to go, Miss Beecham?" said
Sir Malcolm. "Are you not comfortable here?"</p>

<p>"Comfortable, yes," said Meg. She paused as if
hesitating, then she added brusquely, "I do not
think I care much for comfort."</p>

<p>There was something primitive, almost childish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
in Meg's manner; but it gave the impression of the
strength rather than of the weakness of childhood.
It came with a freshness that was as the scent of
the flower rather than that of the toilet perfume.</p>

<p>Meg's mood seemed to pique the old gentleman;
he looked curiously at her, almost as if for the first
time he recognized in her an individuality.</p>

<p>"You do not care for comfort. That is a great
source of independence," he observed.</p>

<p>"I wish to be independent," said Meg with gentle
spirit.</p>

<p>"You are proud. It is a spirit that should be
repressed," he answered.</p>

<p>"I do not know if I am proud," replied Meg, her
low, feeling voice under evident restraint. "I know
it pains me to be here receiving everything, giving
nothing in return."</p>

<p>"What could you give?" he asked with a slight
contraction of his hard lips.</p>

<p>"I could give proofs of what I feel&mdash;gratitude,"
she said.</p>

<p>"I have explained I do not want gratitude," he
replied with chill distinctness. "I do not either
wish to receive it or to inspire it."</p>

<p>"You cannot help my feeling it," Meg broke
out with spirit and with a vivid glance; "that is
beyond your control. You may condemn me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
silence and to apparent apathy, but the gratitude
is here all the same; and because I cannot express
it, it becomes a burden and hurts me."</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which Sir Malcolm
continued to look at Meg with that new look of
curiosity, as if for the first time he recognized her
as a personality.</p>

<p>"Am I to understand," he said slowly, "that you
wish to leave my house because I do not care for
any allusion to be made between us of the part I
have taken in defraying the cost of your education?"</p>

<p>Meg made a quick gesture. "Because you will
let me do nothing for you, and also because I want
to be independent. I would never wish to leave
you if I could be of service to you&mdash;never; but as
you will not let me, I ask you to let me go and
earn my own living."</p>

<p>Sir Malcolm bowed his head. "I understand;
you do not wish to be dependent upon me for your
maintenance."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Suppose," resumed her host after a pause, "I
were to feel disposed to accept the offer you just
now made to me, to replace Mr. Robinson during
his absence, would you allow me to do so?"</p>

<p>Meg gave an exclamation of acceptance.</p>

<div class="figcenter p2" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus265.jpg" width="700" height="433" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Meg reads the morning papers to Sir Malcolm.</span>&mdash;Page 255.</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">"Understand me," said the old man with deliber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>ate
distinctness, looking full at Meg. "It is a
business proposal. I still maintain my point. I do
not want gratitude. If I accept your services, it
is on the condition that you will accept a remuneration."</p>

<p>Meg colored. For a moment she knit her brows,
then she said with effort, "I shall accept the chance
of being of service to you under any condition, sir,
that you may name."</p>

<p>"So be it, then," said the baronet.</p>

<p>At a sign from him Meg sat down and took up
the <i>Times</i>. "Where shall I begin, sir?" she asked.</p>

<p>"With the first leader, if you please," he replied
with an inclination of the head, crossing his knees,
and composing himself to listen.</p>

<p>Meg read, mastering her nervousness with a
strong effort of will. Once or twice she looked up
and caught his eyes fixed upon her, with that new
curiosity in their glance that seemed to humanize
their expression.</p>

<p>After she had read the <i>Times</i>, the political leaders
of the <i>Standard</i>, and selections from its foreign
correspondence under Sir Malcolm's directions, a
third paper remained&mdash;the local organ apparently&mdash;the
<i>Greywolds Mercury</i>. At the murmured injunction
of her auditor, "The leader, if you please,"
Meg once more set upon her task.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>The article handled a book upon the rights of
property which had lately appeared and was making
a stir. As Meg read the opening paragraph
her voice faltered and hesitated. She was reading a
fierce attack upon Sir Malcolm Loftdale.</p>

<p>She looked up distressed and flurried. The old
man set his jaw. "Go on," he said, and Meg continued.
She could scarcely follow the drift of what
she read for sympathy with the pain she was inflicting
upon her benefactor. She confusedly gathered
that Sir Malcolm had raised rents in order to
get rid of certain tenants on his estate; that the
compensation he gave his ejected cottagers might
appear to justify the proceeding, which nevertheless
remained in the eyes of the writer of the article an
infamous cruelty.</p>

<p>"I think this will suffice for to-day, Miss
Beecham," said the baronet, when she had read to
the end.</p>

<p>She rose as he spoke. She noticed he looked
paler. "Is there no letter, sir, that I can write for
you?" asked Meg.</p>

<p>"None this morning, I thank you," he replied
with that fine air of dismissal which awed Meg. He
preceded her to the door, and held it open for her
to pass out.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>THE EDITOR OF THE "GREYWOLDS MERCURY."</h3>


<p>Morning after morning Meg appeared at her
post. She was punctual. As the clock struck ten
her knock sounded at the library door, and she
glided in. The greeting between her employer and
herself was always the same&mdash;a formal and courtly
bow from him, an inclination of the head and
low "Good morning, sir," from her. Then she
would begin to read. She knew the order in which
he liked to listen to the contents of the various
journals. Sometimes also Meg remained to write
letters. She had rebelled at first against the business
contract her benefactor had proposed to her;
she liked it well enough now that she had entered
upon it. The touch of frigidity it brought into the
more emotional relationship of gratitude with which
she regarded him imparted definiteness to their intercourse.
The somewhat elaborate courtesy with
which he treated her lent a charm to service.</p>

<p>On Wednesday and Saturday the <i>Greywolds</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
<i>Mercury</i> appeared among the papers to be read.
Its columns usually contained an attack, covert or
personal, against Sir Malcolm Loftdale. Sometimes
he was mentioned by name; sometimes he
was alluded to in pointed and unmistakable terms
as "a large landed proprietor living in unsympathetic
isolation." In his dealings toward his tenants
he was represented as a tyrant, not so much
actively as passively; and "passive injustice," the
writer maintained, "is worse than active, for it
leaves no hope behind."</p>

<p>Meg felt a flame of indignant protest rising
against this persistent abuse. She would have
skipped the censure so relentlessly pursuing the old
man, who listened in silence with jaw set and lips
compressed; but he always detected the attempt,
and bade her "go on" in a voice so stern that its
tone stopped the reluctant quaver in hers. Meg
knew that her auditor, who never offered a word of
remonstrance or vouchsafed an exclamation as she
read, suffered from these scathing attacks. He
looked paler and feebler, she thought, during the
day, and wandered with more piteous aimlessness
about the park.</p>

<p>One hot Wednesday afternoon she came upon
him asleep in a garden chair in the sunshine. The
feebleness of his aspect strangely appealed to Meg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
He looked so frail and pale. The pride of his appearance
was relaxed. The colorless features, the
delicate hands loosely crossed, might have been
modeled in wax. In the immobility of sleep the
face had a tragic cast. Meg thought it looked like
that of one dead, who in life had suffered beyond
the ordinary lot of man. Pity and indignation
that one so old and stricken should be made to
suffer stirred Meg's heart. For a moment she
looked upon her benefactor, and then she turned
away with moistened eyes.</p>

<p>Meg was no dreamer. She was of an active
nature. As she walked feverishly about the
grounds she found herself remonstrating in imagination
with this venomous persecutor of one who
had cast a spell of interest over her, and to whom
she owed so much. She sometimes stopped in her
walk to complete some angry appeal. Suddenly a
daring thought arose in her mind. She would call
upon this man, and in the strength of a just cause
she would meet him face to face without anger, and
tell him the injury he was doing to an old man's
life. Would she dare to do it? She did not know
the editor's name, but she had noticed that letters
published in the paper were simply addressed to
him in his official capacity. She knew where to
find the office of the <i>Greywolds Mercury</i>. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
seen it one day that she had had occasion to visit
the market town two miles distant. After the first
flash of courage her spirit failed as she approached
the gate. She hesitated. She thought of that
newspaper in the library, and went back and read
the article again. Again her indignation blazed
up. Holding the paper in her hand she set out on
her mission. As she walked she read over portions
of the article to keep her zeal warm. Thus she
proceeded on her way, filled with her theme, yet
faltering.</p>

<p>She reached the town, and turned into the High
Street where the office stood. She easily recognized
it by the posters outside and the advertisements in
the windows. Meg entered the shabby interior
with a desperate effort, and while trembling, yet
full of moral courage, impelled to act by what
seemed to be a duty. A clerk sat at a desk; a
small boy was posting and rolling up the papers.
It was the dingiest corner from which a thunderbolt
could be launched.</p>

<p>"I want to see the editor," she said brusquely.</p>

<p>"He is busy, miss," answered the clerk, surveying
her slowly over his spectacles.</p>

<p>"I want to see him on important business," said
Meg determinedly, trying to look unabashed.</p>

<p>"What name shall I say?" asked the clerk.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Beecham; but he will not know me,"
replied Meg.</p>

<p>The clerk disappeared, and returned after a moment
to say the editor would be glad to see the lady.</p>

<p>They climbed a narrow, dusty flight of stairs that
led to a glass door. It was opened by her guide,
who ushered her into a room that impressed her as
a medley of papers and books. A man, who had
been sitting before a large table, rose at her entrance.
She perceived that he was tall and broad-shouldered,
that his countenance was energetic and
expressive, and his glance brilliant. The lower
part of his face was hidden by a reddish beard; the
closely-cropped hair was of a darker and less ruddy
hue. He bowed to her.</p>

<p>"Are you the editor of the <i>Greywolds Mercury</i>?"
she asked, making another desperate effort to conquer
her shyness.</p>

<p>"I am," he answered.</p>

<p>"If anything appears in the paper that is unjust
it is to you one must appeal?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I hope nothing of this kind has
appeared," he answered. His tone was curt, his
voice deep and not inharmonious.</p>

<p>"It is because something unjust has appeared, and
has been repeated, that I have called upon you,"
said Meg.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed! Would you tell me the particulars?
Pray, sit down," said the editor. If his manner
had a certain <i>brusquerie</i> it was that of self-possession;
it was characteristic of a man accustomed to
speak to business men, and who could listen as well
as talk.</p>

<p>He was dressed with a certain negligence,
but with great neatness. Meg noticed, she knew
not why, his large, well-shaped hand.</p>

<p>"There have been a number of articles upon Sir
Malcolm Loftdale," began Meg.</p>

<p>The editor acknowledged the truth of this statement
by an inclination of the head.</p>

<p>"I know Sir Malcolm well. I am staying at
Greywolds Manor. I am taking the place of his
secretary," said Meg, determinedly ignoring the
shyness that, without chilling her indignation, yet
threatened to overcome her under the scrutinizing
glance of the editor. "I am under great obligations
to Sir Malcolm, I owe him everything."</p>

<p>The editor bowed his head, but did not break the
silence. He appeared to be waiting for more cogent
reasons to be advanced. Meg felt to a certain degree
baffled by his manner.</p>

<p>"You do not know how good he is," she resumed
with energy, "and you represent him as unjust
and tyrannical."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must remember the criticisms are upon
Sir Malcolm in his public capacity of landlord and
magistrate. They do not apply to him as a private
individual," said the editor.</p>

<p>Meg made a movement as if repudiating this line
of argument.</p>

<p>"A man cannot be one thing in his public capacity
and another in his private relationship," she said
quickly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid he can," answered the editor, with
a smile distantly brightening his glance.</p>

<p>"I cannot believe it," said Meg with energy.
"He is old and feeble. It is cruel to hurt him, and
I know those attacks hurts him. He never says a
word. He has never mentioned the subject to me.
I watch him as I read aloud to him, and I think
they will kill him."</p>

<p>"I think you exaggerate their importance," said
the editor, averting his glance in which Meg thought
she detected a sparkle of amusement. After a
moment he resumed with seriousness. "You must
understand me. I do not like to hurt your feelings,
but this is a matter of principle with me. To put
it plainly, Sir Malcolm Loftdale is a bad landlord,
and in a public sense a bad man."</p>

<p>Meg gave an exclamation. "I do not believe it;
I do not accept this statement. You misjudge him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
You do not know him as I know him. He leads a
lonely life and perhaps does not know."</p>

<p>"Exactly! That is one of the reasons that make
him a bad landlord. He ignores the needs of his
tenants by indulging his selfish love of loneliness,
he becomes utterly unsympathetic. He cares nothing
for the laborers who look to him for securing them
the commonest rights, more decent dwellings, fair
rents. And yet what wonder," continued the
editor, turning his head away and speaking as if
to himself, "that he should not care for them, when
he did not care for his own son."</p>

<p>Meg thought of the picture with its face turned
to the wall. She felt she touched a boundary that
lay beyond her self-imposed task, and she rose.</p>

<p>"I see that I am making no way," she said in
hurt accents. "I cannot influence you to abandon
the cruel course you seem determined to pursue.
Nothing remains for me to do but to apologize for
having made the attempt, and to go."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said the editor, rising also, "I am
sorry I should have given this wrong impression of
the interest with which I have listened to your
arguments in favor of Sir Malcolm Loftdale, and of
your appeal against the censure pronounced upon
him in the <i>Greywolds Mercury</i>. But, believe me,
there are many upon his estate who daily talk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
him more bitterly than I do; many who have been
compelled to leave and to face ruin in already over-crowded
cities after accepting his offer of compensation,
which was a hard bargain driven on his side
alone. You do not know, perhaps, the merits of
the case against him. He turns his tenants out, if
they are not punctual with their rents as soon as the
law allows. In his selfish desire for isolation he
allows no cottages to be built on his extensive estates.
He has checked innocent amusements; barred
the right of way. These sufferers represent the
people. I shall not offend you by stating what I
could of the class to which Sir Malcolm belongs.
You see I have argued and discussed the matter
fairly with you," continued the editor, checking the
warmth of his tone.</p>

<p>"I cannot judge the case as you state it," said
Meg with a pained frown. "I am sure it is one-sided."
Then with gathering energy she went on:
"Cannot you conceive that your continued persecution
may drive him to worse acts? It is enough
to make him shun his neighbors to be thus always
held up to them as cruel and exacting. It is enough
to make him wish to remove them from his sight
when he knows that they are taught to revile him.
I know that he is good. Take my case. I owe him
everything; yet I have no claim upon him. Doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>less
mine is not an isolated case. He may be helping
many others in an obscure way. Noble natures
shrink from publicity. I know he shrinks from
being thanked. He will not allow me to thank
him. It almost led to a misunderstanding between
us when I tried to express to him my gratitude.
You talk of his getting rid of tenants after giving
them compensation. What is that suffering compared
to the one you inflict upon him by these
words that may sting to death?"</p>

<p>Meg's defense of her guardian was not logical,
but it was of the heart, and womanly. She ignored
all her antagonist's arguments, and saw everything
colored by her emotions of the moment. The editor
looked at her with a sort of half-amused amazement.
Her vehemence was not to be answered by
balanced sentences or editorial dignity.</p>

<p>"You are so good an advocate," he said, smiling,
"that you almost incline me to be a convert."</p>

<p>"I wish I could convert you to believe in his
goodness&mdash;to me, and perhaps to many others,"
said Meg, with the constraint of shy awkwardness
upon her, as she accepted the homage of his softened
mood.</p>

<p>"His kindness to you is all that I care for," said
the editor, gallantly.</p>

<p>"Will you promise me not to write any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
articles against him?" asked Meg, with the childlike
almost primitive directness that occasionally distinguished
her speech when greatly in earnest.</p>

<p>"I promise to remember your advocacy whenever
I begin to write, or to think of Sir Malcolm Loftdale,"
answered the editor.</p>

<p>"You promise it?" repeated Meg.</p>

<p>"I promise it," said the editor.</p>

<p>After a pause of awkward hesitation Meg bowed
and turned away. The editor held open the door
for her, and she passed out of the dingy office.</p>

<p>As Meg walked home she was conscious of a
certain light-heartedness. The interview had been,
on the whole, antagonistic; yet the impression it
left on her mind was pleasant. The editor was a
stranger, and yet he almost seemed to her a friend.
She could not account for a sense of trustfulness
with which she felt inclined to regard him. There
was nothing to justify this confidence, yet the impression
remained.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h3>FRIEND OR FOE.</h3>


<p>The impression, for which she could give no reason,
that this stranger was a friend remained with
Meg. When on the following Wednesday she
recognized the <i>Greywolds Mercury</i> lying among the
morning newspapers, she looked at its pages with
confidence.</p>

<p>She read the <i>Times</i> abstractedly, eager to get to
the local organ. Her voice lost its intelligent enunciation.
Sir Malcolm, with courteous apologies for
what might be, he owned, his lack of attention,
asked on two occasions for a paragraph to be read
over again, the sense of which he had not gathered.
Meg, the second time, recognized the implied rebuke,
and compelled herself to concentrate her mind
upon her task.</p>

<p>When the turn of the <i>Greywolds Mercury</i> came
she took it up deliberately, and slowly unfolded its
pages. She turned to the leader; she glanced over
it; the print swam before her eyes. The article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
was an onslaught upon Sir Malcolm. Last week
he had passed a hard sentence upon a poacher
caught red-handed in his preserves, and this severity
had roused the editor's ire. Meg dropped the paper
with an exclamation, her heart beat with indignation
and with an exaggerated sense of disappointment.</p>

<p>"What is it, Miss Beecham?" asked Sir Malcolm.</p>

<p>"I cannot read it!" replied Meg unsteadily.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is one of those low-bred, personal
attacks upon myself. Pray do not let it discompose
you, Miss Beecham," said Sir Malcolm with formal
coldness. "I assure you it affects me as little as
would the barking of an ill-bred puppy."</p>

<p>As Meg still hesitated he added, after a moment's
pause, with impassible politeness, "I must beg you,
Miss Beecham, to be so good as to read this article
aloud."</p>

<p>The formality of the tone, into which Sir Malcolm
had infused a touch of command, reminded Meg
that he was her employer, and she proceeded. She
went steadily on to the end. The article seemed to
her to be marked by increased virulence. She
could not judge the merits of the case that formed
the subject of the editor's attack. She did not care
to judge them. These were outside the point.</p>

<p>The concluding phrases ran: "There is a justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
that keeps within the letter of the law, and ignores
every suggestion of compassion and fellow-feeling
for other human beings. But this justice fails in
severity before that which deals out punishment for
breaking the edicts contained in the code of so-called
social honor. The modern Brutus would
immolate not the unhappy peasant only, to whom
belong no human rights, he would immolate his own
son, if he conspired to rebel against the sacred commandments
contained in that code."</p>

<p>Meg was startled by a low exclamation. She
looked up. Sir Malcolm was lying back in his
chair, his eyes closed, his countenance ashen and
drawn.</p>

<p>As she paused he opened his eyes and
looked round; his expression was one of mental
anguish.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, with a ghastly attempt to
assume that fine air of dismissal he knew so well
how to put on, "that will suffice for to-day."</p>

<p>"May I not do something more for you, sir?"
asked Meg, affected by his tone and manner.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I am much obliged," he replied,
turning away and taking up a book.</p>

<p>Meg noticed that his hand trembled. She remembered
the editor's words. "He was not good
to his son."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Was it for this that the reckless allusion to a
father's condemnation of a son to death in the name
of justice had hit him so hard?</p>

<p>She dared no longer intrude upon the presence of
that sorrow or remorse, and left the room. What
did it all mean? She went to the great dining-room
and stood before the picture with its face
turned to the wall. The disgrace appealed to her
with tragic piteousness; and the father's unforgiveness
acted upon her like a chill repulse.</p>

<p>The house seemed full of an unforgiven pain;
the sense of it oppressed Meg, and she wandered
out into the amity of the woodland roads. As she
walked down a narrow path she became aware of
a man approaching toward her from the opposite
direction, with a long stride and an absorbed mien.
She recognized the editor.</p>

<p>The indignation that had been thrust back by the
thought of that unknown sorrow blazed forth anew.
It flamed on her cheek and burned in her eyes. As
the editor came near he met her glance and removed
his hat; but Meg, taking no notice of his salute,
passed on, like a little goddess clothed in the panoply
of her wrath.</p>

<p>As she returned home by another way she was
surprised, and a little offended, to see the editor
loitering near the gates of the park. She was pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>paring
to cut him once more, when he advanced
resolutely toward her.</p>

<p>"May I say a few words to you, Miss Beecham,
with reference to the article that appeared in this
morning's <i>Mercury</i>?"</p>

<p>"I would prefer not," replied Meg curtly.</p>

<p>"I feel an explanation is due. I would like to
justify myself," he said, keeping pace with her as
she walked on with her face turned from him.</p>

<p>"I would rather not approach the subject. No
explanation is possible," replied Meg coldly.</p>

<p>"I think you are mistaken in saying that. Will
you give me the opportunity I ask?"</p>

<p>"I prefer not," repeated Meg, stopping short and
now turning round full upon him. "We approach
this subject from such totally different standpoints,
I feel very seriously about it. You gave your
promise lightly, and as lightly broke it. I asked
it after much hesitation and reluctance. To address
a stranger, to call upon him as I did upon you, was
a strong measure to take&mdash;a reckless one, some
might say. I knew it, I felt it. I put myself into
a false position&mdash;I exposed myself to the insult of
being regarded as one to whom a promise means
no bond."</p>

<p>"Not so. That is unjust. Allow me to say you
are harsh beyond my deserts," replied the editor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
unconsciously raising his voice. Checking himself
he resumed more gently: "You will admit that
the case of the poacher was entirely different. It
was so strong, so startling."</p>

<p>"It was not so much against the matter as against
the manner of your attack upon Sir Malcolm Loftdale
that I appealed, and that you promised to
alter," said Meg, unsoftened.</p>

<p>"I was strongly moved as I wrote," said the
editor, who, somewhat to his surprise, found himself
pleading before this young girl with eager self-justification.
"The severity of the sentence passed
upon the unhappy man&mdash;I know him and his poor
wife&mdash;seemed to me so out of all proportion to the
offense committed that I forgot everything else. It
was only when I looked over the article in print
that I realized how the tone of it might hurt you."</p>

<p>"How it might hurt him! It did hurt him! If
it is a satisfaction to you to know it, the blow struck
home. That allusion to the modern Brutus had its
full effect. It went to his heart!" said Meg passionately,
with flaming eyes.</p>

<p>"I will not pretend to say, Miss Beecham, except
for the apparent neglect of my promise to you, that
I would regret the effect of my words upon Sir
Malcolm. By his coldness and harshness he drove
his son to a piteous death."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know nothing of the story to which you allude;
and I do not wish to know it. I will not
hear it from the lips of an enemy of Sir Malcolm
Loftdale," said Meg almost fiercely. "What I do
know is, that if it is remorse or sorrow that darkens
his old age, it is altogether too sacred a theme
to be dragged into print and made the subject of a
newspaper attack."</p>

<p>The editor was silent a moment, then he said:
"You are right."</p>

<p>The gravity of his tone softened Meg; she hesitated
a moment, then inclining her head she moved
away.</p>

<p>"I wish you would retract what you said just
now concerning your visit to my office," the editor
began somewhat blunderingly&mdash;"that it was a reckless
step&mdash;that you consider that it justified me in
lightly promising and lightly breaking my pledge."</p>

<p>"You must acknowledge, then, that you forgot
all that I said," replied Meg with the childlike
bluntness which characterized her.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, and I will never forget again," he
replied. "Will you not let me discuss the case of the
poacher with you&mdash;of the other wrongs that exist&mdash;will
you help me to advocate the rights of the
tenants and laborers without wounding the landlord?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will never discuss with you again," said Meg
hastily; and with a quick bow she left him and
passed within the gates.</p>

<p>As she went up the avenue she caught sight of
Sir Malcolm wandering up and down the yew-tree
walk. He saw her and came forward to meet her.
The emotion of the morning still left its traces upon
his features. He held a letter.</p>

<p>"I have heard from my late secretary," he said.
"He writes from London. He will be back in a
few days."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, I suppose I must resign my post,"
said Meg in a pained voice. "I have been happy
in serving you."</p>

<p>"You seem to think that all the use you are to
me is to serve me, read to me, work for me. Can
you conceive yourself of no other use?" said Sir
Malcolm in gentler tones than she had ever heard
him speak.</p>

<p>"Of what other use can I be, sir, to you?"</p>

<p>"The use of bringing pleasure to me by your
simple presence in my house," he said, taking her
hand.</p>

<p>"I would be unhappy if I felt myself an idle dependant
upon you, sir," Meg said, shy pride giving
a touch of awkwardness to her attitude and an embarrassed
tone to her voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Were you fond of your task?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I liked it, sir," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then I will write to Mr. Robinson that he may
stay where he is. Do not think that I shall be inconsiderate,"
he went on as she looked up anxiously.
"I know that his wish is to find a situation in London.
I can get him just the post he desires. Have
an easy conscience about him. If you will, indeed,
stay to be an old man's eyesight and his right hand,
I will be grateful to you. I should be lonely now
without you. Will you stay with me, Meg?"</p>

<p>"I will stay with you, sir, till you send me away,"
said Meg with zeal; and to her surprise she found
herself in tears, moved to the heart at the old man's
tone of unexpected tenderness.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h3>FRIEND!</h3>


<p>From that day a subdued tone of affectionate
confidence entered into the relations between Meg
and her guardian. Sir Malcolm did not emerge
from the seclusion in which he lived so much as
from his cold and distant manner. He still took
his meals alone, he spent his evenings in solitude,
he still wandered alone in the park; but his taciturnity
was less marked. He often joined Meg in
the grounds, and sometimes they drove out together
into the surrounding country.</p>

<p>While continuing to treat her with that dignified
courtesy that had a charm for Meg, he assumed toward
her a gentle familiarity which kept up a
reminder of that unexpected tenderness which had
so profoundly moved her on the day when he asked
her to stay with him. It was the only time she had
seen him relax his stateliness of manner. Meg never
knew him to depart from a lofty composure of demeanor.
He never gave way to irritability; but if
a servant was neglectful of orders, memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
severity visited this breach of duty. Toward her
Sir Malcolm assumed a splendid deference. The
flowers he plucked for her he presented with a suggestion
of the superb homage a regent might give
to a child-queen. As he walked and talked with
her his conversation showed an appreciation of
rustic beauty, and gave evidence of intellectual culture.
He told her the names of the trees; he
related anecdotes of country life and manners, of
illustrious statesmen and persons of note whom he
had known; he sometimes flavored his conversation
with quotations from the works of classic authors.
Sir Malcolm acknowledged, with that fine air which
was not one of boasting, still less one of apology,
that he knew nothing of contemporary literature
outside that of the newspapers&mdash;his literary studies
terminated with that of the wits of Queen Anne's
reign. He spoke with an easy choice of words that
gave a balanced elevation to his language. This
gentler mood dispelled the fear Meg had felt in his
presence, and the fascination grew that he exercised
over her. The nobility, the dignity, the sternness
of the old man's appearance&mdash;the recognition that
he was always at his best with her, who was a dependant,
added to the spell he exercised over her.
The gentle and subtle artificiality&mdash;perhaps it were
better to say the art&mdash;of his manners influenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
those of Meg, and they acquired by contact with
him an added grace of reserve and composure.</p>

<p>The attacks in the <i>Mercury</i> had ceased. Meg attributed
Sir Malcolm's brighter mood to their cessation.
Week after week elapsed, and the local print,
while advocating as forcibly as before the right of
the laboring classes to happier conditions brought
into their lives, abstained from all personal or covert
allusions to Sir Malcolm Loftdale. Meg felt grateful.
The editor had done this for her, and the
desire grew upon her to thank him.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as she walked about the grounds,
she began timidly to draw the baronet's attention
to the softened tone of the <i>Greywolds Mercury</i>.</p>

<p>Sir Malcolm reared his head, and turning upon
her a countenance the features of which seemed to
stand out with added definiteness, he said with
haughty distinctness: "I have noticed nothing.
What an insolent radical thinks fit to say or not to
say, matters nothing to me. I utterly ignore it. I
regard it as I would regard the advocacy of ruffianism
by a member of the criminal classes."</p>

<p>"The attacks pained me," began Meg with regretful
hesitation, struggling to master her timidity.</p>

<p>"I know it," replied Sir Malcolm; "and I thank
you for your kind heartedness. It was unnecessary
pain that you felt. Believe me, the whole affair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
was unworthy of your consideration. Disdain is
the only attitude to assume toward such conduct.
No means are too contemptible for a low-born demagogue
to adopt for the attainment of his aims."</p>

<p>"But, do you not admit, sir," said Meg with a
slight tremor in her deep tones, "that liberalism, if
mistaken, yet has its principles?"</p>

<p>"Principles!" repeated Sir Malcolm with scornful
clearness. "The burglar, doubtless, has his principles
when he picks my lock, and is silent lest he
might awake the house. Never mention this man
or his paper again."</p>

<p>He left her; and Meg, with a shadow over her
face, walked slowly away. She thought there was
a certain injustice in not recognizing the altered
tone of the newspaper, and the wish came to her
more strongly to thank the editor for the deference
he had paid to her request.</p>

<p>The next day she was driving out with Sir Malcolm.
The way home lay through the straggling
market-town, down the High Street, in which stood
the office of the <i>Mercury</i>. The baronet seldom
spoke during a drive, he sat back with that cold and
distant air which seemed to withdraw him from his
surroundings. The scene impressed itself and made
a picture in Meg's mental vision: the red-tiled roofs
of the irregular houses coming out against the lemon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
sky; the office on the southern side of the thoroughfare,
the ugly posters glaring in the late sunlight.
As they passed the office Meg glanced in its
direction; her eyes met those of a man emerging
from the doorway. It was the editor. A chill
force, that seemed to emanate from the white-haired
immobile presence by her side, compelled
her to withdraw her eyes and turn them coldly
away. It was but for a flash, then Meg looked
round to bow and smile her thanks; but the editor
had already turned away and was walking with
swift, long strides up the street.</p>

<p>Self-upbraidings kept Meg silent during the drive
home. The opportunity that she had wished for, of
showing to this stranger that she thanked him for
his generous fulfillment of the promise he had given
to her, had presented itself, and she had used the
opportunity to wound him. She sat still and unhappy.
In the loneliness of the evening, the pain
of having offered what might well be interpreted
as an affront by one who had been kind made her
restless. A feverish longing came to her to remove
the hurt she had given. She thought she would
write to this stranger who seemed a friend; but
when she endeavored to do so she found the task
too difficult. His very name was unknown to
her. Allusion to the apparent rudeness of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
conduct seemed but to emphasize the incivility she
had offered and make explanation inadequate. She
put down her pen, and set about thinking once
more. She would call upon him and explain! The
resolve brought a sense of flurry; but the more she
thought over it the more she grew reconciled to it.
She owed it to him. She had been to him in anger
and to expostulate; she would go to him now in
reconciliation and to thank.</p>

<p>The next morning her resolve had not grown the
less, but the stronger, for the night's sleep upon it.
Meg felt impatient for the hour to come when she
could put it into execution. A fretful apprehension
was upon her that she would not be able to fulfill
her intention. Sir Malcolm proved that day in a
mood for relishing her company. With reluctant
feet she accompanied him in a ramble through the
park. She lent an inattentive ear to his reminiscences
in stately English of times long past, of folk
who had played their part and were now out of the
world's wrangles and reconciliations, its loves, its
friendships and estrangements.</p>

<p>Meg was free at last, and with a sense of relief
she quickly made her way through the stretching
country to the old market town. She did not falter
or slacken her pace until she came within sight of
the office, then a sudden shyness overcame her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
She took some restless steps backward and forward,
debating with herself; then the sense that this
stranger had been kind to her, that she owed him a
debt of gratitude, and that she had inflicted a
wound upon him, resumed its ascendency and she
went in.</p>

<p>The clerk told her that his master was out. "But
I expect him back in five minutes," he added.
"Will you walk upstairs, miss?"</p>

<p>Meg was once more shown by her guide into the
dingy sanctum. It was as she had seen it before&mdash;littered
with books, with strips of proof-sheets, and
dust. It was imbued with a smell of tobacco. The
masculine personality that permeated the room
worked upon Meg, and brought on a fit of shyness
more overwhelming than the first. Shame at being
here came over her, and a longing to escape before
the master of the place appeared. She determined
to scribble off a few words before he returned.</p>

<p>Writing implements surrounded her on every
side. She took up a pen and a sheet of paper. As
she drew toward her an ink bottle she knocked
something down on the floor. She stooped to pick
it up. As she did so a picture hanging in an obscure
corner caught her eye. It was in a rude
frame. It looked like a colored plate cut out of a
fashion-book of some years back. Meg started and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
drew her breath; a crowd of emotions passed over
her. She knew every cluster of roses on that white
ball-dress; she knew the affected grace of the
simpering figure's posture; she remembered that
mended tear right across the page. As she looked
at it the room in which she sat became full of the
hubbub of a London street. It was a room similar
to this one&mdash;littered with books and paper, imbued
with the smell of tobacco; in it sat a young man
with kind bright eyes, and a mane of blond hair;
he was carefully pasting that inane representation
of a lady, and by his side a child, neglected and
forlorn, stood eagerly watching the strong hands as
they repaired the beloved print.</p>

<p>A mist gathered before Meg's eyes. This child
in the shabby frock was herself; this battered and
mended fashion-plate was the idolized imaginary
picture of her mother. That young man with the
kind eyes and the deft fingers, who was he?</p>

<p>Meg was still gazing at the conventional figure
in the ball-dress when the door opened, and the
editor walked in.</p>

<p>She vaguely recognized that his demeanor was
altered. He bowed distantly.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Meg recognizes the old fashion-plate</span>.&mdash;Page 284.</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">"I came to thank you and to explain," began
Meg, and paused. Memory had touched her eyelids
and she recognized him. The puzzling recollection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
that had obtruded itself with vague pertinacity
asserted itself triumphantly. She knew now why
she had thought of this stranger as a friend.</p>

<p>"To explain?" he repeated; and he, too, paused.</p>

<p>"Yes; about yesterday. I saw you," she said
abruptly, almost mechanically, as if speaking by
rote and eager to get done; "but I was afraid to
bow to you, because I was with Sir Malcolm
Loftdale. It was mean and weak of me when I
owe you so much."</p>

<p>"You owe me nothing. You convinced me, and
I acted upon my new conviction," he answered, still
in a distant tone.</p>

<p>"I have much to be thankful to you for," she
repeated in a voice that was hoarse with emotion.
"Where did you get this?" she added brusquely,
interrupting herself and pointing to the fashion-plate.</p>

<p>He looked surprised and said:</p>

<p>"I have had it some years."</p>

<p>"Who gave it to you?" she asked.</p>

<p>He looked curiously at her. "A story is attached
to that picture," he answered evasively.</p>

<p>"Is your name William Standish?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "Did you not know my name
was Standish?" he added, puzzled by the expression
of her face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>She shook her head in denial. "Was it a child
gave you this picture?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, monosyllabic in his surprise.</p>

<p>"To her foolish, lonely fancy was it the portrait
of her mother, who had died in giving her birth?"</p>

<p>"That is true," he replied. Then he added earnestly,
"Do you know anything of that child? Can
you tell me anything about her? I have tried to
find her. I have made many efforts to do so, but
in vain. I have lost all clew to her."</p>

<p>"Was her name Meg?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, her name was Meg&mdash;dear little Meg!" he
said, his eyes shining softly, as if he were seeing
before him an image that delighted him.</p>

<p>"I am, or rather I was little Meg," she said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"You?" he exclaimed, looking at her.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"But I thought your name was Beecham," he
said. "That of Meg, I understood, was Browne."</p>

<p>"Till I went to school I believed my name was
Browne; but one day I was told it was Beecham,"
she said.</p>

<p>"You Meg, little Meg!" he replied, his eyes traveling
slowly over her. "I can scarcely believe it."</p>

<p>"But all the same it is I!" she said with a laugh,
as he kept looking at her. "Let me prove my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
identity&mdash;put me to the test; you will see how correctly
I will answer," she said. "I remember the
night when you put that patch on the old fashion-plate.
I had crumpled it up in despair because you
said that probably my mother was not a lady."</p>

<p>"That is true!" he replied, still looking scrutinizingly
at her.</p>

<p>"I remember how I used to tease you about your
dinners. I was quite motherly with you!"</p>

<p>"Motherly! Grandmotherly! Bless you, little
Meg!" he cried, and then he laughed. "Is it you?
Is it really you?" and he stretched out his two
hands.</p>

<p>Meg placed hers into their clasp. "Yes, it is
little Meg for whom you did that kind thing, of
stopping the attacks upon Sir Malcolm."</p>

<p>"That was for tall Meg!" he said.</p>

<p>"Tall Meg, who I fear, did what little Meg would
never have done: appearing to ignore a kindness
out of fear."</p>

<p>"No, no, we will not talk of that. It was so
natural," he said, still looking at her with surprised
and friendly eyes.</p>

<p>They fell to chat, interchanging memories of
those old childish days. He walked with her across
the country to the gates of the park, and as they
walked still they chatted of that fond, silly past.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>FOR "AULD LANG SYNE."</h3>


<p>Although Meg could not explain to herself the
right of authority Sir Malcolm had over her, she
felt it and acknowledged his control. The temptation
often came to enjoy the society of the friend
of her childhood, but her honest nature shrank from
meeting him secretly; and yet the attacks on the
old baronet that had appeared in the local paper
precluded the possibility of mentioning to him its
editor's name.</p>

<p>Still she longed to see Mr. Standish. One day
she thought she would venture to ask Sir Malcolm's
permission. She began, blundering a little about
the debt of gratitude which she owed to him, and
which it was her pleasure to acknowledge; his
wishes, she said, would ever influence her in her
acts and her conduct. Then, with a blush, she admitted
there was something she wished to do, for
which she wished to get his permission. Meg was
amazed at the manner in which the old gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
met her advances. He distinctly disclaimed any
shadow of authority over her.</p>

<p>"But you have been so good to me, sir," she
replied. "But for you, when I ran away from
school&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When you ran away from school," he interrupted
with unexpected coldness. "I was almost
inclined, when you refused to enter the carriage, to
leave you on the road. If I have given you protection
it is for reasons I do not care to explain. I
have told you, I do not want gratitude. The tie
between us is a voluntary one. You are free as air,
young lady, but always with a risk. Your acts
will not be disobediences, though they may be imprudences.
Distinctly remember you are your own
mistress. Keep your secrets if you have any. I
do not demand your confidence."</p>

<p>"Free as air!" rang through Meg's heart. "I
am my own mistress; free to meet my friend
again."</p>

<p>After this extraordinary ebullition of candor
from Sir Malcolm, the old gentleman's kindness
seemed to regain its late level. Meg even fancied
that he was kinder, as if he endeavored thus to
salve any wound to her feelings which his temporary
harshness might have occasioned.</p>

<p>Still he had said she was free as air, and Meg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
now felt justified in acting as her heart impelled
her. The winter came and went, but it brought
no sense of dreariness or bleakness to Meg. She
had found the friend of her childhood, and the reflection
of her childhood's days shone over everything.
It was no wonder that she felt some of the
charm of the old companionship with him who had
been good to her when all the world had neglected
her; and the memory of whose kindness had set a
halo about the memory of her forlorn life.</p>

<p>She asked herself no questions concerning the
nature of this new interest; she knew only that
until it came back to her she was as one walled in,
and without daylight. The real Meg had lived
captive in a state of repression; to no one had she
ventured to tell her impressions; but to this friend
she could speak of the most trivial event, and confide
the most intimate thought. He drew her out
with a frank tenderness that won her simple trust.
There grew a fascination to walk and to talk with
him; to tell him all that had happened to her since
the day of their parting. She had never forgotten
him; the thought of him had ever dwelt in her mind,
ready to start up and welcome him at his coming.
And although it was still her pleasure and her duty
to minister to her benefactor's need, yet by his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
injunction she felt herself free to yield to the refreshment
and delight of those meetings.</p>

<p>They met at sunset, after the journalist's work
was done, in the wood behind the house; and their
trysting-place was an elm.</p>

<p>"It looks like an old wizard," said Mr. Standish,
pointing to the leafless tree standing gaunt against
the dying light.</p>

<p>"Old Merlin!" said Meg; "and there is the eerie
brightness about him. He is going to throw a spell
over us."</p>

<p>The prediction proved true; a spell was cast
about Meg's life, and she loved no spot on earth as
she loved the place by that tree.</p>

<p>No young girl ever set forth to her first ball with
more expectation and longing than did Meg feel in
anticipation of some new chat with the lost friend
whom she had found again. Endless, endless appeared
to her the sources of interesting conversation
and of sentiment that he had at his command,
and each time they met and talked it seemed to her
that he opened a new world of thought and imagination
for her spirit to dwell in.</p>

<p>They had a thousand subjects to speak about.
Every topic came at random. They cared not
which it was, for each seemed ever new. Meg was
like a child who has never seen the sea, now picking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
up rainbow shells by the shore; every shell different
in the heap lying beside her in a glorious chance
medley.</p>

<p>Sometimes he entertained her with scenes of
travel, of striving and success. Sometimes they
interchanged memories, mutually reminding each
other of incidents in the past. With grave humor,
followed by hearty laughter, he would describe the
part she had played in some scene where she had
behaved with great motherliness and dignity toward
him. He would tell her how she had never despaired
of him, although the bailiffs were after him.</p>

<p>"But I was a sad trouble to you, Meg," he vowed.
"You were a little tyrant then. Where is all that
tyranny gone?"</p>

<p>"You give me no excuse to exercise it," she replied
one day. "The instinct may be there still;
but you are so good, so absorbed in work now."</p>

<p>"Ah, if you only knew it!" he exclaimed. "Little
Meg would have been more quick-sighted. She
would have sternly reproved me, and preached to
me about wasting my time when I should be furnishing
copy."</p>

<p>"Copy! What is copy?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Blessed ignorance! Copy is that which goes to
fill those columns of print. It is what the hungry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
printer clamors for, and looks very black when he
does not get."</p>

<p>Meg laughed.</p>

<p>"You speak as if printers were wild beasts fed
with leaders on schemes for extending the franchise
or removing some dowdy old tax."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I am a humbug. All the time that
I am writing these leaders I am thinking of coming
to see you; I hurry through my work in order to
be in time to meet you, Meg," he answered.</p>

<p>"Then I will meet you no more if I spoil your
work," she said gravely.</p>

<p>"There spoke the child. All the severity of the
little monitor of yore is in those accents," he replied
with a laugh. "No, Meg, I work all the better
to earn my play."</p>

<p>"Your play?" she said slowly, with a slight emphasis
on the word; and she was silent awhile. The
expression remained with her, casting its little
shadow of doubt, and she would harp back upon
it.</p>

<p>"Is this your play?" she would question gravely,
when he said anything complimentary.</p>

<p>They had their merry wrangles, their desperate
fallings-out, their pretty makings-up. Meg, with
characteristic repartees, parried his thrusts, and
their intercourse was sweet with wholesome laugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>ter.
With a blunt playfulness she met anything
approaching to sentiment.</p>

<p>"While I was waiting," he said one day, "there
was a little bird up there&mdash;you'll hear it&mdash;which
continually says, 'She'll come! she'll come!'"</p>

<p>"And I heard a cuckoo in the wood as I came
along," she replied; "he cried nothing but 'Copy!
copy! copy!'"</p>

<p>"It must have been the printer's devil," he said,
"when I was taking a holiday."</p>

<p>An innocent coquetry, which was the simple outcome
of delight in her ever-growing happiness,
would tinge her manner with a little salt of aggressiveness.
She sometimes played at making him jealous.</p>

<p>She was late one day; she had been detained, she
explained, by a fascinating being.</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>She would not tell his name, but vowed he had
splendid lustrous eyes, and a mustache an officer
in the guards might envy.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish laughed, and seemed inclined to
turn the conversation to another topic.</p>

<p>"You do not ask his name," she said; "yet this
fascinating creature made me late, and with difficulty
I tore myself from his spell."</p>

<p>"But you came," he replied, falling into her mood.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"My sense of duty. I am naturally punctual. I
push it to a weakness."</p>

<p>"I wish to forget him," he said; "he has robbed
me enough. What is the name of the country
bumpkin?"</p>

<p>"Country bumpkin, indeed! He wears a coat
the fit of which the most fashionable tailor might
well envy the secret of its cut&mdash;a coat black and
glossy, with just a touch of white at the throat."</p>

<p>"The rector. I knew it. Confess it is the rector,"
Mr. Standish said with finger uplifted.</p>

<p>"No white-haired rector, indeed," said Meg.</p>

<p>"Then the curate? All the ladies are fascinated
by the curate."</p>

<p>"Not the curate. My charmer is an inmate of
the house."</p>

<p>"An inmate?" repeated Mr. Standish, perplexed.</p>

<p>"On the day of my arrival he was so pleasant
and cordial his greeting almost made me feel at
home."</p>

<p>"I wonder who he is!" said Mr. Standish.</p>

<p>"As you look troubled, I will be generous and
tell you," said Meg, and paused.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Standish, "who is he?"</p>

<p>"My charmer of the admirable coat, the impressive
mustache, and the splendid eyes is&mdash;well&mdash;my
black cat. He it was who received me cordially,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
sat by my fire, purred a welcome, and followed me
about with a tail straight as that;" and she lifted
her parasol to a perpendicular.</p>

<p>Sometimes the talk drifted to Sir Malcolm's son,
who had been the editor's friend, and whose portrait,
turned to the wall, appealed with a piteous interest
to Meg, and was always recurring to her mind.</p>

<p>"He had many faults," Mr. Standish admitted
one day. "He was reckless, but there was a winsomeness
about him that won hearts; and the fault
he committed which rankled deepest in the old
baronet's mind was an action that came nearer to
a virtue."</p>

<p>"What was that fault?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He married the woman he loved. She was the
prettiest, sweetest woman I ever saw. Absurd as
it may seem, Meg, the first time I saw you grown
up you reminded me of her. It was simply fancy,
of course the likeness is lost now. It seems to have
gone out."</p>

<p>"Do you think it was because of this marriage
that his portrait was turned to the wall?" persisted
Meg.</p>

<p>"I think so. At least this I know: Sir Malcolm
never forgave that marriage."</p>

<p>"But why?" asked Meg.</p>

<p>"Because she was poor and brave enough to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
for her living. I believe she was a governess; but
her trials came after their marriage. His debts
accumulated, his father was unforgiving; he sometimes
had to hide."</p>

<p>"What became of her?" still questioned Meg.</p>

<p>"She died when her child was born. After her
death he certainly grew more reckless. He was
unhappy, and I think he had some remorse. The
marriage took place on the continent."</p>

<p>"Did the child live?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He certainly had no home for it.
He never alluded to it. I believe he was not with
his wife when she died."</p>

<p>"Poor wife!" said Meg, thinking of that unhappy
wife who had suffered so much, who had died so
neglected and uncared for. "Is it not strange,"
she continued after a pause, "that it should have
been my guardian's son who was the friend for
whom you almost beggared yourself?"</p>

<p>"And for having done which, do you remember,
you stroked my head?" he replied smilingly.</p>

<p>She answered him with a blush only.</p>

<p>Sometimes he spoke to her as to a comrade out
of the fund of his large experience and knowledge.
His interest in the working classes appealed to her,
and life seemed to grow wider from the solicitude
that he brought into it for others. There grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
every day in her heart a reliance, a sort of wide
faith in him, as if all he said and thought must be
right.</p>

<p>The winter passed and the spring came round;
the sap rose in the earth and the pulses of nature
quickened.</p>

<p>They met oftener. Sometimes they wandered
forth to meet each other in the dewy
mornings, when the fields shone like gossamer.
There, in the woods, where the birds wearied themselves
for listeners, they came on the scene. Meg
would bid him forget his politics, his ink-bottle, in
honor of all the loveliness around.</p>

<p>"Look at this clump of daffodils," she said one
morning when a mood of mirthful raillery was
upon her, pointing to the silly flowers. "Don't
they look like Hebes drooping their gold cups?
Ah! everything is young and merry, sir, but your
old politics&mdash;your dull old politics."</p>

<p>Then he vowed he would never talk politics to
her again, upon which she coaxed and played the
little siren until he relented, complaining that she
honeycombed his will by her cajoleries.</p>

<p>An exaltation stirred Meg's spirit&mdash;the girl who
had been silent and reserved was full of innocent
gayety; and still that companionship with one who
had brought happiness to her childhood continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
simple, familiar, and charming, as it might be between
dearest friends.</p>

<p>Sir Malcolm had an attack of illness, and as Meg
devoted herself to him for some time there were no
meetings at the elm. Then she became conscious of
the value of the enchantment this new-found relationship
brought into her life; and when they met
again she was aware of a subtle change in the sentiment
with which she regarded the relations between
Mr. Standish and herself.</p>

<p>While compelling herself to greet him with the
same equable friendliness, she was often chilled by
the awkwardness of self-restraint. The facile word
lagged when she tried to assume an attitude of
bantering reserve, and her sincere nature oftener
hid itself behind that of shy formality. She would
then gravely inquire of his work, awkwardly plunge
into politics or surface topics, but after awhile in
his reassuring presence the pain of her embarrassed
spirit would vanish, and she would feel comforted.
In the sweetness of restored harmony between
them, after the jar of repression, her heart would
expand, and again she would weave around him a
web of delicate sympathy and winsome pleasantry.
She would be a child again, and would display her
old quickness of mood to suit his disposition&mdash;gay
when he wished to be gay, serious when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
serious, silent when he was inclined for silence. In
this childlike docility and wistful eagerness to please
him dwelt the old wakeful and sensitive pride, quick
to take alarm, easily perplexed. The happy confidence
would take flight like a frightened bird, the
laughter of her heart would be quenched, the trustful
approaches of her spirit checked as quickly as
had been those of the susceptible child, so coy and
yet so devoted.</p>

<p>One day he did not come. In the evening she
received a note of explanation. He had been detained
by business; he had come too late, and he
had waited, hoping some kindly inspiration would
lead her to see if he had kept tryst after the appointed
hour. But she had not come. Would she
be gracious and come the next day?</p>

<p>After a debate with herself Meg sallied forth.
Again he was not there, and a dull, unhappy anger
took possession of her. She was returning at once,
but a shower came. She stood under a tree waiting
for it to pass, but the trailing cloud seemed never to
empty. She was angry, and she felt about to cry
for being imprisoned there. The raindrops began
to saturate the tree. She would not forgive him;
twice to have failed her! She had her upbraiding
of him so perfect by going over it, she wished he
might come in time to deliver it. She heard steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
approaching, and she kept her eyes sternly before
her. It was only a countrywoman with sloppy
shoes. Her heart went down, and tears rushed to
her eyes; and so full was she of her grievance that
when he joined her with the rain streaming from
his hat she started, not having heard him come, and
all her prepared reproaches left her memory. She
did not give him her hand, however, and tried to
flick away the telltale tears.</p>

<p>"I am late again. I am so sorry. I could not
help it," he said earnestly.</p>

<p>"But I can help coming in future," said Meg in a
severe tone.</p>

<p>"No, you could not punish me like this," he said.
"It was a telegram from London upon which I was
obliged to write a short article which kept me.
That article was written in such desperation that I
shall be afraid to read it in print. Won't you give
me your hand?"</p>

<p>"The shower is over. I think I shall go back,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Do you see that black cloud shaped like an
Inverness cape? It is coming right up with its
deluge."</p>

<p>"All the more reason that I should hurry home,"
she said.</p>

<p>"But consider, Meg," he replied, smiling down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
upon her; "what an undignified retreat. Before
you have gone a hundred yards you will be obliged
to break into a run, and finally make another stage
under yonder elm tree, where I will rejoin you;
and then we will begin all over again. Nothing
like a good rainstorm for a reconciliation. But all
the grace of it is gone. Come now, I have felt the
first menacing drop upon my nose. Make friends,
it says."</p>

<p>She looked at him with scrutinizing gravity, then
a smile broke.</p>

<p>"I cannot resist the drop's appeal," she replied
with a laugh, and she put out her hand. "Still, for
all the rain in the world," she continued, "I must
air my grievance. I had a good right to be angry.
I waited nearly twenty minutes yesterday."</p>

<p>"I waited two hours," he replied.</p>

<p>"But you came at a wrong hour," she said. "I
came at the hour you appointed. Look at this&mdash;just
look at this, and you will be silent."</p>

<p>She took out his note, opened it, and held it under
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know," he said; "that perjured note.
But all is forgiven now."</p>

<p>The cape of cloud passed away, and the sun came
out.</p>

<p>There was a good-humored strength about Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Standish that puzzled Meg, and she often longed to
pierce the mystery&mdash;at least the mystery to her&mdash;of
his nature. But after a time his manner changed;
a melancholy grew upon him. One day he turned
and said: "You call me your friend, Meg. You
keep dwelling on the memories of those fond silly
days of your childhood. But you are a child no
longer. Perhaps we had better think of one another,
and cease those happy walks."</p>

<p>"Cease those walks!" she exclaimed with a gasp
in her voice. He remained silent. Then she said
proudly: "If you think so, really&mdash;" but her voice
failed, and with a sudden cry she exclaimed, "I
knew it could not last&mdash;that you must tire of me."</p>

<p>"Tire of you, Meg!" he cried, facing round upon
her. "It is because I love you that I say this.
But it is not as the friend of your childhood that I
love you. We must make no mistake. I love you
as the man loves the one woman in all the world
he wants for his wife. If you cannot accept that
love from me I would prefer not to see you again."</p>

<p>She did not reply, and she averted her face.
When she looked slowly up, even in the tension of
waiting for her answer, he felt something of the
thrill he might have experienced if a spirit had
answered to his call. The child he had known was
looking back at him. A something he had missed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>&mdash;a
mystery of spiritual identity with the Meg of long
ago, glimmerings of which he had caught&mdash;had
waked up. It was the child grown to be a woman&mdash;endowed
with a woman's soul, gifted with a thousandfold
powers of feeling. She did not speak;
her silence, her quivering features, her kindling
countenance answered him.</p>

<p>"Meg!" he said in a low voice, and bending forward
he drew her to him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h3>BEFORE THE PICTURE.</h3>


<p>Meg delayed announcing the news of her engagement
to Sir Malcolm. She feared the effect upon
him of hearing that she had betrothed herself to
the man who had written those attacks in the local
newspaper. Sir Malcolm had been ailing during
the winter.</p>

<p>"She could not leave him yet," she told her lover.
"It was her duty to remain with him." And he
agreed that it was for awhile.</p>

<p>The crisis, however, came sooner than she anticipated.
A trouble had been fermenting in Sir
Malcolm's secret thoughts. He had noticed Meg's
absences. Always regular at her post at the hours
when he required her services as secretary and
reader, he missed her companionship in his walks;
he had lost the certainty of meeting her in the
drawing-room, in her little study with her books,
or at the piano.</p>

<p>One morning, on returning from her tryst in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
woods, she met the baronet at the gates of the park.
"You are out early, Miss Beecham," he said with
constrained courtesy.</p>

<p>"I hope, sir, I am not late," she replied anxiously.</p>

<p>"You are always punctual&mdash;a model of punctuality&mdash;in
the discharge of your duties. It is scarcely
half-past ten," he replied in a ceremonious tone,
with the slightest emphasis on the word duties. As
they walked toward the house he added, "Far be
it from me to imply that I have a right to claim
more of the pleasure of your society than you care
to give me."</p>

<p>"I am afraid, sir, you have missed me&mdash;" she
began.</p>

<p>"I have told you I am a solitary; I miss no one,"
he interrupted with that directness of speech which
might have been brutal, had it not been veiled by
the art he possessed of lofty politeness.</p>

<p>"There is something I want to tell you, sir, that
I ought to have told you before," began Meg, her
heart beating and her cheeks flushing, as she felt
that the hour of revelation had come.</p>

<p>The baronet's gaze rested upon her with an illconcealed
flicker of anxiety. But he said in his
finest manner that he would be happy to listen to
anything she had to say; but perhaps the interview
had best be deferred until they reached his study.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>When they came there Meg began hesitatingly:
"The post that I have filled, sir, in your household
has been one of pleasure to me; still what is difficult
to say I must say now&mdash;I must resign it."</p>

<p>"Resign it!" exclaimed Sir Malcolm, bending his
eyes upon her. "For what reason?"</p>

<p>"I have formed an attachment, sir. I am engaged
to be married," she replied with the calmness of
fright.</p>

<p>"Married!" ejaculated Sir Malcolm. "Engaged
without having consulted me! Nonsense; you
mean to tell me&mdash;" He paused. "But this is monstrous."
He got up, walked up and down the room.
Meg watched him in silence, astonished at what
seemed to her an extraordinary outburst of emotion.
After a few moments Sir Malcolm regained
his composure, and sitting down again said in a constrained,
business-like tone, "You will admit that,
at least, as your guardian, I should have been told
of this before. To whom are you engaged?"</p>

<p>She hesitated under the influence of a gaze, the
keenness of which stopped confidence at its source.</p>

<p>"To one who was very good to me in my childhood.
When no one else cared for me he was my
only friend."</p>

<p>"Have you corresponded with him ever since
your childhood?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sir; I met him here. I had lost sight of
him for years."</p>

<p>"Is he of low birth?" asked the baronet with
frigid brusqueness.</p>

<p>"No, sir. But if he were&mdash;" She paused and
looked at the old man with a glance steady as his
own.</p>

<p>"I understand. You assert your right to marry
who you will&mdash;clodhopper or landowner. Perhaps,
however, you will admit, as I observed just now,
that as your guardian I am justified in asking
questions about this young man?"</p>

<p>"I gladly admit it, sir, and thank you; for it is
another proof of the interest&mdash;the generous interest&mdash;you
have lavished upon me," she said
warmly.</p>

<p>"May I ask to what profession he belongs?" demanded
Sir Malcolm.</p>

<p>"He is a writer," said Meg, and paused.</p>

<p>"A writer? That is somewhat vague," said Sir
Malcolm.</p>

<p>"A journalist," she resumed, and again she
paused.</p>

<p>Sir Malcolm knit his brows.</p>

<p>"It is difficult for me to explain," continued Meg,
raising her eyes and speaking low, but quite firmly.
"The circumstances that led to our meeting were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
so strange&mdash;in a manner they are painful. They
may place me in a false light&mdash;I may appear ungrateful.
The friend of my childhood is Mr.
Standish, the editor of the <i>Greywolds Mercury</i>."</p>

<p>"Of the paper that dragged my name into print
and held it up to public ignominy in its columns?"
observed Sir Malcolm.</p>

<p>Meg bowed her head, and said falteringly:
"These articles led to our meeting. I had called at
the office to remonstrate, to expostulate with the
writer."</p>

<p>"To expostulate, to remonstrate!" cried Sir Malcolm
with a burst of outraged pride. "What!
You exposed me to this humiliation; you begged
quarter for me of this insolent radical. It was a
grievous injury you did me!" He checked himself,
then resumed with deliberate calm: "But let that
pass. It is your marriage with this man we were
discussing. I forbid it; I cannot countenance such
an engagement."</p>

<p>"I think, sir," said Meg after a pause, speaking
steadily, but in a feeling voice, "that after reflection
you will admit that you are claiming too much
authority over me. Mr. Standish and I love each
other, and we admit the right of no third person to
part us. I know you have been my secret benefactor
for a long time; yet it is more than a benefactor's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
due you are claiming. A father only would have
the right to impose the authority over me you demand
to establish."</p>

<p>"It is this authority over you that I demand and
that I rightly possess," said the baronet in a weighty
voice, rising and drawing himself up. "You are
my only son's only child. I stand in your father's
place toward you. I am your grandfather."</p>

<p>"My grandfather!" said Meg stupidly. Everything
grew indistinct around her except the figure
of the old man, standing erect, authoritative, the
sun shining on his white hair, illumining it like a
halo round his head.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" he said. He turned and she followed
automatically. He preceded her down
the great staircase. The perfume of flowers came
to her dreamily. Still she followed her guide
on and on&mdash;vaguely conscious that some great issue
was at hand.</p>

<p>They entered the large dining-room. Sir Malcolm
had signed to two servants in the hall to follow.</p>

<p>They walked straight to where the picture hung
with its face turned to the wall, an outcast among
that goodly painted company.</p>

<p>At the order of the master the picture was turned,
and the servants left the room. "That is your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
father's portrait," said Sir Malcolm in a voice that
sounded without a quaver.</p>

<p>She knew that he turned away and left her standing
there, looking at the representation of a young
man dressed in a scarlet and gold uniform. He had
a gallant and winsome air, his features were femininely
delicate, the blue, small eyes bright, the lips
full. As a sudden realization that she was looking
at her father's face came to her, a tumult of feeling
swept over Meg. Then came a chill and a disappointment.
The countenance said nothing to her;
she gazed at it dry-eyed.</p>

<p>She moved away. Sir Malcolm's glance was
steadily averted. As she approached he looked
round. His features were tense with suppressed
emotion; a flicker of wildness lit the eyes, lustrous
with unshed tears.</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful face," said Meg softly, moved
by the evidences of a mental struggle that gave a
crazy look of anguish to the old face; "but it is not
dear to me, sir, as yours is dear."</p>

<p>"It does not do him justice; he was the handsomest
lad in the country," said the old man. "I
loved him, Meg; I staked all my pride in life
upon him. When he disgraced me my pride in life
left me."</p>

<p>"Ah! how could he bring this sorrow upon you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
sir?" murmured Meg, scarce knowing what she
said, confused by this outburst of confidence from
one whom she had always known so reticent.</p>

<p>"He brought dishonor upon our name," said the
old man. Meg saw that he flushed and that he
trembled; but he went on quietly nevertheless. "I
must explain to you now why this picture was
turned to the wall. I must tell you&mdash;what is agonizing
to me to tell, and must be painful to you to
hear; but the circumstances compel me. He
wronged you. I have tried to fill his place toward
you. He married your mother abroad, and under
a false name. He contracted debts&mdash;debts of honor&mdash;that,
having the money, he yet never paid. Thank
God! the extent of his dishonor was never made
public." Sir Malcolm paused, then he resumed:
"His last act was, perhaps, the redeeming feature
of his life. He killed himself. His suicide showed
that a gleam of the old spirit made a dishonored
life unbearable to him."</p>

<p>Meg did not speak. The horror of that tragedy
filled the room. After a silence the old man resumed
in his more habitual manner and tone:</p>

<p>"We need never refer to this unhappy story again.
Ask me nothing concerning your mother; I never
saw her, and know next to nothing about her. She
died in giving you birth." Again he paused, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
slowly with effort he said: "Will you forgive me,
Meg, for your neglected childhood?"</p>

<p>Meg made a deprecatory gesture, and uttered an
exclamation. These words of entreaty from him
hurt her like a blow.</p>

<p>"I ask you to forgive it," continued the baronet
with emotion. "I humbly ask it from my soul. I
have remorse for it. I admit that in your childhood
I looked upon you with aversion&mdash;that your
coming here was a pain to me; and yet I loved
you before you came."</p>

<p>"Before I came?" murmured Meg, astonished.</p>

<p>"I have loved you ever since the day I brought
you back to school. When I saw you so spent with
anguish and fatigue, lying on the cushions before
me, my heart went out to you. I stopped my
carriage when I was driving off after having left
you; I returned, I came to your little bedside and
kissed you in the dark."</p>

<p>"Then it was you who gave me that kiss!"
faltered Meg. "I have never forgotten it." And
on the impulse she pressed her lips on his thin hand.</p>

<p>"You have made me love you&mdash;you have wound
yourself round my heart. Forgive me, Meg," said
the old man.</p>

<p>"Do not ask me to forgive you, sir. I have received
nothing but good from you," said Meg.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say it, Meg," the old man urged. "Say,
'Grandfather, I forgive it and forget it.'"</p>

<p>"As you wish I will say it, sir. I forgive&mdash;"
began Meg.</p>

<p>"Say, 'Grandfather,'" he interrupted.</p>

<p>"Grandfather, I forgive it and forget it," repeated
Meg, stretching out her hands.</p>

<p>He took them then, looking down into her eyes.
"Can you, forgetting the part I played of neglect,
forget also the part of kindness played in it by that
man? For my sake can you forget it?"</p>

<p>The words struck the chords of Meg's heart and
filled it with the memory of the love that had
come to her in her forlornness, and that now filled
her life with all youth's appeals.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I can never forget that&mdash;never!" she
said, loosening her hands from his grasp and stepping
away.</p>

<p>"If you persist in this engagement, I will not
disguise it from you, Meg, you will strike the last
prop from under me&mdash;it will break my heart!" said
Sir Malcolm.</p>

<p>The words crushed once more the rising mutiny
in Meg's heart. The tyranny of pity mastered its
revolt&mdash;insisted upon the new duty to the new
loyalty.</p>

<p>She moved away restlessly; then suddenly throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>ing
her arms up with a gesture of despair she sank
into a chair, and hiding her face in her hands she
burst into tears.</p>

<p>The old man waited until her sobs grew quieter;
then he said:</p>

<p>"Come with me, Meg; we will go to Mr. Standish
together."</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h3>IN THE EDITOR'S OFFICE.</h3>


<p>A few moments later Meg was walking by her
grandfather's side. He had refused to drive. Sir
Malcolm never said a word, but he seemed in hot
haste. Meg's thoughts were in a tumult. What
was he going to do? How would he meet his
former enemy? Had he been softened?</p>

<p>The old baronet gripped his stick as he went
along and planted it firmly on the road. She would
have given anything to have questioned him; but
fear on the one hand lest she should exasperate him,
on the other a failing heart lest if he were inclined
to conciliation she might balk the impulse by some
well-meant blunder kept her silent.</p>

<p>When they reached the office, and her grandfather
asked the clerk if Mr. Standish was at home,
she tried to judge his mood by the tone of his voice.
For an instant she hoped the clerk's answer would
be in the negative; but the young man, leaving his
desk, replied that Mr. Standish was at home, adding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
with an air of bewilderment: "Sir Malcolm Loftdale,
I believe?"</p>

<p>"Take my card up," said the baronet, pulling out
his cardcase.</p>

<p>They climbed up the narrow stairs, and Meg saw
her lover standing by his table to receive them.
With a bow as cold, Mr. Standish returned the old
gentleman's frigid salutation. He was stretching
out his hand to her, but with a little anxious frown
she signaled to him to take no notice of her at present.</p>

<p>"You are, I believe, sir, the responsible editor of
the <i>Greywolds Mercury</i>," said the baronet with a
chill civility that brought a sorrowful anticipation
to Meg.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish in a constrained voice acknowledged
his position. "I am afraid that this places me in
an unfavorable light before you, sir," he continued
in a half-apologetic tone.</p>

<p>Sir Malcolm moved his hand. "You mistake the
object of my visit if you think, sir, that I ask for
an explanation&mdash;if you suppose that articles upon
myself which appeared some months ago, and which
no doubt had literary merit, have produced upon
me the slightest impression. I am ready to admit
the right of every man to his opinions. I have my
own opinions on a subject which I would prefer not
to express."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused, and Mr. Standish remained silent,
waiting for his visitor to continue.</p>

<p>"My motive for entering a publishing office," the
baronet went on, looking round him with a cold
smile, "is from a widely different motive. I will
refer to one of those articles only for the simple
sake of illustration. You were very indignant, sir,
at my stringent suppression of a poacher. Now,
sir, I beg you in justice to give me your opinion of
a poacher in a moral sense&mdash;one who, by assignations,
by means at his command, contrives to inveigle
the affections of a young girl, almost a child,
intruding himself thus dishonestly into a gentleman's
family."</p>

<p>"Sir Malcolm Loftdale," said Mr. Standish firmly
yet courteously, "I perfectly understand your
meaning. This young lady occupies an honorable
position in your household, and she has always led
me to understand that you treated her with the
utmost kindness and consideration; but she is not a
member of your family."</p>

<p>"Such being your impression, I will not presume
to blame you," said the baronet with the cynical
courtesy one uses to an inferior. "Your honorable
intentions I take for granted. It only remains for
me to inform you, in the presence of this young
lady&mdash;who has herself been made acquainted by me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
within the hour of the position she holds in my
house&mdash;that Miss Beecham is my granddaughter."</p>

<p>"Your granddaughter!" repeated Mr. Standish
with a movement of surprise. "I thought, sir, you
had but one child&mdash;a son?"</p>

<p>"She is the daughter and only child of that son,"
answered the baronet with lofty curtness. "There
is no necessity for me to enter with you into the
details of a family history. Suffice it to say that I
beg of you, as an honorable literary man"&mdash;the
old gentleman laid a slight sarcastic stress on the
word literary&mdash;"never again to address this lady,
and to terminate from this moment an acquaintance
which, if pursued, must be henceforth termed clandestine,
treacherous, and dishonorable."</p>

<p>At these words Mr. Standish drew himself up
with a dignity as cold and stern as was that of his
visitor. "Sir Malcolm Loftdale," he said, "this
comes rather late. It is not for me to give the
pledge you exact; I will give it at the request of
Miss Beecham only."</p>

<p>For a moment irritation seemed about to surprise
the old gentleman. He clinched his stick and
reared his grand old head as for a rebuke; then he
turned mutely toward Meg.</p>

<p>"You have applied the word dishonorable to me,
Sir Malcolm Loftdale. Allow me to say it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
last word, I think, you should have employed," resumed
Mr. Standish.</p>

<p>"Sir, your protestations are thrown away upon
me. I have no more to say to you," replied the
baronet. "Meg, my child, it is now for you to
decide. You have heard the expression of my
positive wishes; you know how I feel on this
subject; you know better than any one how your
decision one way or the other will affect me. I
confide in you."</p>

<p>Meg wrung her hands and remained silent. In
her despair she confusedly felt she was called upon
to make her choice between two duties. One was
heavy to follow, the other meant all the happiness
of her young heart. She gave an inarticulate moan&mdash;a
word of that primal language common to all
creation in its moments of anguish.</p>

<p>"I do not ask you to speak," said Sir Malcolm.
"Put your hand on my arm, Meg, and let me take
you home&mdash;that will suffice."</p>

<p>"I cannot&mdash;I cannot!" she moaned, moving a few
irresolute steps away from the two between whom
her fate lay. She could not speak the word that
must bring sorrow to one who was weak, lonely,
and already heavily stricken, still less that other
word which must crush the young, the strong, and
the beloved one.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"Before you ask this young lady to retract," she
heard the voice of her lover say; then he paused
as if to change the phrase to one more generously
worded: "Before you ask her to refuse me for your
sake, will you grant me a few moments' private
conversation?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered the baronet. "I repeat I
have said all I have to say to you. I wish this
interview to end. Come back with me, Meg."</p>

<p>"You have addressed me as one capable of dishonorable
conduct," Mr. Standish resumed quietly.
"This young lady's father, sir, if he were alive,
would have been the last to apply such a term
to me."</p>

<p>"Her father! What do you know of her father?"
said Sir Malcolm savagely.</p>

<p>"If Philip Loftdale was her father, I knew him
well. He often called me his dearest friend."</p>

<p>Meg, leaning back against the wall, saw her
grandfather staring vacantly at the speaker. "What
do you mean? Who are you, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Again I ask you, sir," said Mr. Standish with
sudden gentleness, "for a few moments' private
conversation."</p>

<p>"No, sir; if you have anything to say, speak out
before this young lady. I took the step of leading
Miss Beecham here that she might judge the merits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
of the case for herself. I am sorry to have to add
that the assertion you have just made, that you
were my son's friend, is no recommendation to me.
He was unfortunate in his associates."</p>

<p>Mr. Standish did not reply. He took out a bunch
of keys and fitted one into a drawer. Meg saw
him draw out a bundle of letters. He kept his eyes
averted from her as he said:</p>

<p>"I shrink from telling the particulars I must now
state, or of hinting at an obligation. But I am
playing for a great stake&mdash;one that is all the world
to me; and I see no means of moving you, sir, but
by referring to this fact, and bringing evidences of
its truth before you."</p>

<p>He laid his hand upon the letters.</p>

<p>"It is your wish, sir, that I should speak before
Miss Beecham. Perhaps it is as well that she should
hear what I have to say."</p>

<p>"It is my wish. Go on, sir!" said Sir Malcolm
fiercely as Mr. Standish paused.</p>

<p>"Your son was adjutant of his regiment. Whatever
were his follies and recklessness, he was a good
soldier. He was trusted by his comrades, and he
was proud of their trust. You were stern with
him, sir&mdash;I shall not say overstern. It is not for
me to judge."</p>

<p>"Go on, sir," said the old man.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"Since his marriage, if you remember, you held
no communication with him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If your claim upon me," interrupted the baronet
fiercely, "is that you are a relation of the unhappy
woman he married, I think you must admit that the
fact that I have recognized her daughter, and that
I mean publicly to declare her my grandchild, is a
reparation which answers all claims and silences all
appeals."</p>

<p>"I make no claim upon you. I think I will
establish that I am no&mdash;" Mr. Standish paused,
then resumed: "If you remember, your son wrote
to you shortly before his death a letter that you
returned unopened, as you had done others before."</p>

<p>Sir Malcolm did not reply, and for a moment
there was a dead silence. Mr. Standish resumed
with difficulty:</p>

<p>"That letter, sir, was to ask you for three hundred
pounds, that in a reckless moment he had
taken from the money belonging to his regiment,
convinced that he would be able to repay it."</p>

<p>Still the old man remained silent as death, looking
with a fixed gaze upon the speaker.</p>

<p>"Your son came to me. Dishonor faced him.
He told me of his folly. The next day he would
be disgraced if he failed to raise the money."</p>

<p>Sir Malcolm drew a heavy breath; he parted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
lips as if to speak, but no words came; and he
listened intently.</p>

<p>"God knows, sir," resumed the young man, "that
I tell you what follows with the utmost unwillingness.
I had the money he needed so sorely, and I
let him have it. His honor was saved. His act
remained unknown to his brother-officers and to the
world, but he felt the stigma too bitterly to live."</p>

<p>The old man sat down and took the proffered
documents. He read them through hurriedly, and
Meg noticed that once he brushed away a tear.
Then he rose, and with a large and liberal action
put out a trembling hand to the editor, who clasped
it in his.</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish," said the baronet, "you have
saved what is dearer to me than life&mdash;my family
honor. I will do, sir, what I have never done before.
I ask your pardon. I acknowledge an
obligation to you that I can never repay."</p>

<p>"You can repay it, grandfather," said Meg
through tears.</p>

<p>"You can repay it, sir&mdash;ay, and brimming over,"
said Mr. Standish. "The stake I have played for,
as I said, is all the world to me. I love this lady
with a love that can never change. I loved her as
a child, I love her as a girl, I will love her as a
woman all her life. Do not part us!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>"Grandfather, do not part us!" repeated Meg in
a voice hoarse with pleading. "I will never desert
you!"</p>

<p>The old gentleman hesitated. He resumed his
seat, and putting his elbow on the table he covered
his eyes with his hand. There was anxious silence
in the room. At last Sir Malcolm rose, and with a
grave dignity he went to Meg, and taking her hand
he placed it in that of her lover.</p>

<p>The adventures of the son of a Scotch officer in French service.
The boy, brought up by a Glasgow bailie, is arrested for aiding a
Jacobite agent, escapes, is wrecked on the French coast, reaches
Paris, and serves with the French army at Dettingen. He kills
his father's foe in a duel, and escaping to the coast, shares the
adventures of Prince Charlie, but finally settles happily in Scotland.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of 'Quentin Durward.' The lad's
journey across France, and his hairbreadth escapes, make up as good a narrative
of the kind as we have ever read. For freshness of treatment and
variety of incident Mr. Henty has surpassed himself."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p></blockquote>

<span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With 12 full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon
Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in
India and the close of his career was critical and eventful in the
extreme. At its commencement the English were traders existing
on sufferance of the native princes. At its close they were masters
of Bengal and of the greater part of Southern India. The author
has given a full and accurate account of the events of that stirring
time, and battles and sieges follow each other in rapid succession,
while he combines with his narrative a tale of daring and adventure,
which gives a lifelike interest to the volume.</p>

<blockquote><p>"He has taken a period of Indian history of the most vital importance,
and he has embroidered on the historical facts a story which of itself is deeply
interesting. Young people assuredly will be delighted with the volume."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p></blockquote>

Wars of Religion. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations
by <span class="smcap">John Schönberg</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this story Mr. Henty gives the history of the first part of the
Thirty Years' War. The issue had its importance, which has extended
to the present day, as it established religious freedom
in Germany. The army of the chivalrous king of Sweden was
largely composed of Scotchmen, and among these was the hero of
the story.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The tale is a clever and instructive piece of history, and as boys may be
trusted to read it conscientiously, they can hardly fail to be profited."&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In this story the author gives an account of the fierce struggle
between Saxon and Dane for supremacy in England, and presents
a vivid picture of the misery and ruin to which the country was
reduced by the ravages of the sea-wolves. The hero, a young
Saxon thane, takes part in all the battles fought by King Alfred.
He is driven from his home, takes to the sea and resists the Danes
on their own element, and being pursued by them up the Seine,
is present at the long and desperate siege of Paris.</p>

R.I. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>Boys reading the history of the Punic Wars have seldom a keen
appreciation of the merits of the contest. That it was at first a
struggle for empire, and afterward for existence on the part of
Carthage, that Hannibal was a great and skillful general, that he
defeated the Romans at Trebia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannæ,
and all but took Rome, represents pretty nearly the sum total of
their knowledge. To let them know more about this momentous
struggle for the empire of the world Mr. Henty has written this
story, which not only gives in graphic style a brilliant description
of a most interesting period of history, but is a tale of exciting
adventure sure to secure the interest of the reader.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Well constructed and vividly told. From first to last nothing stays the
interest of the narrative. It bears us along as on a stream whose current
varies in direction, but never loses its force."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p></blockquote>

Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>.
12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish
War of Independence. The extraordinary valor and personal
prowess of Wallace and Bruce rival the deeds of the mythical
heroes of chivalry, and indeed at one time Wallace was ranked
with these legendary personages. The researches of modern
historians have shown, however, that he was a living, breathing
man&mdash;and a valiant champion. The hero of the tale fought under
both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical accuracy
has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is
full of "hairbreadth 'scapes" and wild adventure.</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is written in the author's best style. Full of the wildest and most remarkable
achievements, it is a tale of great interest, which a boy, once he has
begun it, will not willingly put on one side."&mdash;<i>The Schoolmaster.</i></p></blockquote>

<span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon
Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>The story of a young Virginian planter, who, after bravely
proving his sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters, serves
with no less courage and enthusiasm under Lee and Jackson
through the most exciting events of the struggle. He has many
hairbreadth escapes, is several times wounded and twice taken
prisoner; but his courage and readiness and, in two cases, the
devotion of a black servant and of a runaway slave whom he had
assisted, bring him safely through all difficulties.</p>

<blockquote><p>"One of the best stories for lads which Mr. Henty has yet written. The
picture is full of life and color, and the stirring and romantic incidents are
skillfully blended with the personal interest and charm of the story."&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p></blockquote>

By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by
<span class="smcap">Alfred Pearse</span>, and Maps. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>The story of two English lads who go to Holland as pages in
the service of one of "the fighting Veres." After many adventures
by sea and land, one of the lads finds himself on board a
Spanish ship at, the time of the defeat of the Armada, and escapes
only to fall into the hands of the Corsairs. He is successful in
getting back to Spain under the protection of a wealthy merchant,
and regains his native country after the capture of Cadiz.</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is an admirable book for youngsters. It overflows with stirring incident
and exciting adventure, and the color of the era and of the scene are
finely reproduced. The illustrations add to its attractiveness."&mdash;<i>Boston

Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">W. S. Stacey</span>, and
Two Maps. 12mo, cloth, price $1.50.</p></blockquote>

<p>The conquest of Mexico by a small band of resolute men under
the magnificent leadership of Cortez is always rightly ranked
among the most romantic and daring exploits in history. With
this as the groundwork of his story Mr. Henty has interwoven the
adventures of an English youth, Roger Hawkshaw, the sole survivor
of the good ship Swan, which had sailed from a Devon port
to challenge the mercantile supremacy of the Spaniards in the
New World. He is beset by many perils among the natives, but
is saved by his own judgment and strength, and by the devotion
of an Aztec princess. At last by a ruse he obtains the protection
of the Spaniards, and after the fall of Mexico he succeeds in regaining
his native shore, with a fortune and a charming Aztec
bride.</p>

<blockquote><p>"'By Right of Conquest' is the nearest approach to a perfectly successful
historical tale that Mr. Henty has yet published."&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p></blockquote>

By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">J. Schönberg</span>.

<p>Harry Sandwith, a Westminster boy, becomes a resident at the
chateau of a French marquis, and after various adventures accompanies
the family to Paris at the crisis of the Revolution. Imprisonment
and death reduce their number, and the hero finds
himself beset by perils with the three young daughters of the
house in his charge. After hairbreadth escapes they reach Nantes.
There the girls are condemned to death in the coffin-ships,
but are saved by the unfailing courage of their boy protector.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Harry Sandwith, the Westminster boy, may fairly be said to beat Mr.
Henty's record. His adventures will delight boys by the audacity and peril
they depict.... The story is one of Mr. Henty's best."&mdash;<i>Saturday
Review.</i></p></blockquote>

<span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon
Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the present volume Mr. Henty gives an account of the struggle
between Britain and France for supremacy in the North
American continent. On the issue of this war depended not only
the destinies of North America, but to a large extent those of the
mother countries themselves. The fall of Quebec decided that
the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New World;
that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the
nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the
English language, and English literature, should spread right
round the globe.</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is not only a lesson in history as instructively as it is graphically told,
but also a deeply interesting and often thrilling tale of adventure and peril by
flood and field."&mdash;<i>Illustrated London News.</i></p></blockquote>

By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by
<span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this story the author has gone to the accounts of officers who
took part in the conflict, and lads will find that in no war in which
American and British soldiers have been engaged did they behave
with greater courage and good conduct. The historical portion of
the book being accompanied with numerous thrilling adventures
with the redskins on the shores of Lake Huron, a story of exciting
interest is interwoven with the general narrative and carried
through the book.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British soldiers during
the unfortunate struggle against American emancipation. The son of an
American loyalist, who remains true to our flag, falls among the hostile redskins
in that very Huron country which has been endeared to us by the exploits
of Hawkeye and Chingachgook."&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p></blockquote>

Century. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by
<span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>A story of Venice at a period when her strength and splendor
were put to the severest tests. The hero displays a fine sense and
manliness which carry him safely through an atmosphere of intrigue,
crime, and bloodshed. He contributes largely to the victories
of the Venetians at Porto d'Anzo and Chioggia, and finally
wins the hand of the daughter of one of the chief men of Venice.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Every boy should read 'The Lion of St. Mark.' Mr. Henty has never produced
a story more delightful, more wholesome, or more vivacious."&mdash;<i>Saturday
Review.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>A Final Reckoning</b>: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia. By <span class="smcap">G. A.
Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">W. B. Wollen</span>,
12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>The hero, a young English lad, after rather a stormy boyhood,
emigrates to Australia, and gets employment as an officer in the
mounted police. A few years of active work on the frontier,
where he has many a brush with both natives and bushrangers,
gain him promotion to a captaincy, and he eventually settles
down to the peaceful life of a squatter.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr. Henty has never published a more readable, a more carefully constructed,
or a better written story than this."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>Under Drake's Flag</b>: A Tale of the Spanish Main. By <span class="smcap">G. A.
Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>.
12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>A story of the days when England and Spain struggled for the
supremacy of the sea. The heroes sail as lads with Drake in the
Pacific expedition, and in his great voyage of circumnavigation.
The historical portion of the story is absolutely to be relied upon,
but this will perhaps be less attractive than the great variety of
exciting adventure through which the young heroes pass in the
course of their voyages.</p>

<blockquote><p>"A book of adventure, where the hero meets with experience enough, one
would think, to turn his hair gray."&mdash;<i>Harper's Monthly Magazine.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The author has woven, in a tale of thrilling interest, all the details
of the Ashanti campaign, of which he was himself a witness.
His hero, after many exciting adventures in the interior, is detained
a prisoner by the king just before the outbreak of the war,
but escapes, and accompanies the English expedition on their
march to Coomassie.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr. Henty keeps up his reputation as a writer of boys' stories. 'By Sheer
Pluck' will be eagerly read."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>By Pike and Dyke</b>: A Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic.
By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Maynard
Brown</span>, and 4 Maps. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this story Mr. Henty traces the adventures and brave deeds
of an English boy in the household of the ablest man of his age&mdash;William
the Silent. Edward Martin, the son of an English sea
captain, enters the service of the Prince as a volunteer, and is employed
by him in many dangerous and responsible missions, in the
discharge of which he passes through the great sieges of the time.
He ultimately settles down as Sir Edward Martin.</p>

<span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon
Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>No portion of English history is more crowded with great events
than that of the reign of Edward III. Cressy and Poitiers; the
destruction of the Spanish fleet; the plague of the Black Death;
the Jacquerie rising; these are treated by the author in "St.
George for England." The hero of the story, although of good
family, begins life as a London apprentice, but after countless adventures
and perils becomes by valor and good conduct the squire,
and at last the trusted friend of the Black Prince.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr. Henty has developed for himself a type of historical novel for boys
which bids fair to supplement, on their behalf, the historical labors of Sir
Walter Scott in the land of fiction."&mdash;<i>The Standard.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>Captain's Kidd's Gold</b>: The True Story of an Adventurous Sailor
Boy. By <span class="smcap">James Franklin Fitts</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is something fascinating to the average youth in the very
idea of buried treasure. A vision arises before his eyes of swarthy
Portuguese and Spanish rascals, with black beards and gleaming
eyes&mdash;sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the
Spanish Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long,
low schooner, of picaroonish rake and sheer, to attack an unsuspecting
trading craft. There were many famous sea rovers in
their day, but none more celebrated than Capt. Kidd. Perhaps
the most fascinating tale of all is Mr. Fitts' true story of an adventurous
American boy, who receives from his dying father an
ancient bit of vellum, which the latter obtained in a curious way.
The document bears obscure directions purporting to locate a certain
island in the Bahama group, and a considerable treasure
buried there by two of Kidd's crew. The hero of this book,
Paul Jones Garry, is an ambitious, persevering lad, of salt-water
New England ancestry, and his efforts to reach the island and
secure the money form one of the most absorbing tales for our
youth that has come from the press.</p>

<p>A frank, manly lad and his cousin are rivals in the heirship of a
considerable property. The former falls into a trap laid by the
latter, and while under a false accusation of theft foolishly leaves
England for America. He works his passage before the mast,
joins a small band of hunters, crosses a tract of country infested
with Indians to the Californian gold diggings, and is successful
both as digger and trader.</p>

<p>An interesting story of the last war in Afghanistan. The hero,
after being wrecked and going through many stirring adventures
among the Malays, finds his way to Calcutta and enlists in a regiment
proceeding to join the army at the Afghan passes. He accompanies
the force under General Roberts to the Peiwar Kotal,
is wounded, taken prisoner, carried to Cabul, whence he is transferred
to Candahar, and takes part in the final defeat of the army
of Ayoub Khan.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Captured by Apes</b>: The Wonderful Adventures of a Young
Animal Trainer. By <span class="smcap">Harry Prentice</span>. 12mo, cloth, $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>The scene of this tale is laid on an island in the Malay Archipelago.
Philip Garland, a young animal collector and trainer, of
New York, sets sail for Eastern seas in quest of a new stock of
living curiosities. The vessel is wrecked off the coast of Borneo
and young Garland, the sole survivor of the disaster, is cast ashore
on a small island, and captured by the apes that overrun the
place. The lad discovers that the ruling spirit of the monkey
tribe is a gigantic and vicious baboon, whom he identifies as
Goliah, an animal at one time in his possession and with whose
instruction he had been especially diligent. The brute recognizes
him, and with a kind of malignant satisfaction puts his former
master through the same course of training he had himself experienced
with a faithfulness of detail which shows how astonishing
is monkey recollection. Very novel indeed is the way by
which the young man escapes death. Mr. Prentice has certainly
worked a new vein on juvenile fiction, and the ability with which
he handles a difficult subject stamps him as a writer of undoubted
skill.</p>

<p>There are few great leaders whose lives and actions have so
completely fallen into oblivion as those of the Earl of Peterborough.
This is largely due to the fact that they were overshadowed

time, he showed a genius for warfare which has never been surpassed.</p>

<p>A story which will give young readers an unsurpassed insight
into the customs of the Egyptian people. Amuba, a prince of the
Rebu nation, is carried with his charioteer Jethro into slavery.
They become inmates of the house of Ameres, the Egyptian high-priest,
and are happy in his service until the priest's son accidentally
kills the sacred cat of Bubastes. In an outburst of popular
fury Ameres is killed, and it rests with Jethro and Amuba to
secure the escape of the high-priest's son and daughter.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>With Washington at Monmouth</b>: A Story of Three Philadelphia
Boys. By <span class="smcap">James Otis</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>Three Philadelphia boys, Seth Graydon "whose mother conducted
a boarding-house which was patronized by the British
officers;" Enoch Ball, "son of that Mrs. Ball whose dancing
school was situated on Letitia Street," and little Jacob, son of
"Chris, the Baker," serve as the principal characters. The
story is laid during the winter when Lord Howe held possession
of the city, and the lads aid the cause by assisting the American
spies who make regular and frequent visits from Valley Forge.
One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread was
scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless prodigality
shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in
feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army
but a few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger.
The story abounds with pictures of Colonial life skillfully
drawn, and the glimpses of Washington's soldiers which are given

study.</p>

Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">S. J. Solomon</span>. 12mo,
cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Henty here weaves into the record of Josephus an admirable
and attractive story. The troubles in the district of Tiberias, the
march of the legions, the sieges of Jotapata, of Gamala, and of
Jerusalem, form the impressive and carefully studied historic
setting to the figure of the lad who passes from the vineyard to
the service of Josephus, becomes the leader of a guerrilla band of
patriots, fights bravely for the Temple, and after a brief term of
slavery at Alexandria, returns to his Galilean home with the favor
of Titus.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr. Henty's graphic prose pictures of the hopeless Jewish resistance to
Roman sway add another leaf to his record of the famous wars of the world."&mdash;<i>Graphic.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>Facing Death</b>; or, The Hero of the Vaughan Pit. A Tale of
the Coal Mines. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations
by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Facing Death" is a story with a purpose. It is intended to
show that a lad who makes up his mind firmly and resolutely that
he will rise in life, and who is prepared to face toil and ridicule
and hardship to carry out his determination, is sure to succeed.
The hero of the story is a typical British boy, dogged, earnest,
generous, and though "shamefaced" to a degree, is ready to face
death in the discharge of duty.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The tale is well written and well illustrated, and there is much reality in
the characters. If any father, clergyman, or schoolmaster is on the lookout
for a good book to give as a present to a boy who is worth his salt, this is the
book we would recommend."&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>Tom Temple's Career.</b> By <span class="smcap">Horatio Alger</span>. 12mo, cloth,
price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tom Temple, a bright, self-reliant lad, by the death of his
father becomes a boarder at the home of Nathan Middleton, a
penurious insurance agent. Though well paid for keeping the
boy, Nathan and his wife endeavor to bring Master Tom in line
with their parsimonious habits. The lad ingeniously evades their
efforts and revolutionizes the household. As Tom is heir to
$40,000, he is regarded as a person of some importance until by
an unfortunate combination of circumstances his fortune shrinks
to a few hundreds. He leaves Plympton village to seek work in
New York, whence he undertakes an important mission to California,
around which center the most exciting incidents of his
young career. Some of his adventures in the far west are so
startling that the reader will scarcely close the book until the last
page shall have been reached. The tale is written in Mr. Alger's
most fascinating style, and is bound to please the very large class
of boys who regard this popular author as a prime favorite.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Maori and Settler</b>: A Story of the New Zealand War. By
<span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Alfred Pearse</span>.
12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Renshaws emigrate to New Zealand during the period of
the war with the natives. Wilfrid, a strong, self-reliant, courageous
lad, is the mainstay of the household. He has for his friend
Mr. Atherton, a botanist and naturalist of herculean strength and
unfailing nerve and humor. In the adventures among the Maoris,
there are many breathless moments in which the odds seem hopelessly
against the party, but they succeed in establishing themselves
happily in one of the pleasant New Zealand valleys.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Brimful of adventure, of humorous and interesting conversation, and
vivid pictures of colonial life."&mdash;<i>Schoolmaster.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>Julian Mortimer</b>: A Brave Boy's Struggle for Home and Fortune.
By <span class="smcap">Harry Castlemon</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is a story that will warm every boy's heart. There is
mystery enough to keep any lad's imagination wound up to the
highest pitch. The scene of the story lies west of the Mississippi
River, in the days when emigrants made their perilous way across
the great plains to the land of gold. One of the startling features
of the book is the attack upon the wagon train by a large party of
Indians. Our hero is a lad of uncommon nerve and pluck, a brave
young American in every sense of the word. He enlists and holds
the reader's sympathy from the outset. Surrounded by an unknown
and constant peril, and assisted by the unswerving fidelity
of a stalwart trapper, a real rough diamond, our hero achieves the
most happy results. Harry Castlemon has written many entertaining
stories for boys, and it would seem almost superfluous to
say anything in his praise, for the youth of America regard him
as a favorite author.</p>

<blockquote><p>"<b>Carrots:</b>" Just a Little Boy. By <span class="smcap">Mrs. Molesworth</span>. With
Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Walter Crane</span>. 12mo, cloth, price 75 cents.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"One of the cleverest and most pleasing stories it has been our good fortune
to meet with for some time. Carrots and his sister are delightful little
beings, whom to read about is at once to become very fond of."&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>"A genuine children's book; we've seen 'em seize it, and read it greedily.
Children are first-rate critics, and thoroughly appreciate Walter Crane's
illustrations."&mdash;<i>Punch.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>Mopsa the Fairy.</b> By <span class="smcap">Jean Ingelow</span>. With Eight page
Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, price 75 cents.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Mrs. Ingelow is, to our mind, the most charming of all living writers for
children, and 'Mopsa' alone ought to give her a kind of pre-emptive right to
the love and gratitude of our young folks. It requires genius to conceive a
purely imaginary work which must of necessity deal with the supernatural,
without running into a mere riot of fantastic absurdity; but genius Miss Ingelow
has and the story of 'Jack' is as careless and joyous, but as delicate,
as a picture of childhood."&mdash;<i>Eclectic.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>A Jaunt Through Java</b>: The Story of a Journey to the Sacred
Mountain. By <span class="smcap">Edward S. Ellis</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>The central interest of this story is found in the thrilling adventures
of two cousins, Hermon and Eustace Hadley, on their
trip across the island of Java, from Samarang to the Sacred Mountain.
In a land where the Royal Bengal tiger runs at large;
where the rhinoceros and other fierce beasts are to be met with
at unexpected moments; it is but natural that the heroes of this
book should have a lively experience. Hermon not only distinguishes
himself by killing a full-grown tiger at short range,
but meets with the most startling adventure of the journey.
There is much in this narrative to instruct as well as entertain the
reader, and so deftly has Mr. Ellis used his material that there is
not a dull page in the book. The two heroes are brave, manly
young fellows, bubbling over with boyish independence. They
cope with the many difficulties that arise during the trip in a fearless
way that is bound to win the admiration of every lad who is
so fortunate as to read their adventures.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Wrecked on Spider Island</b>; or, How Ned Rogers Found the
Treasure. By <span class="smcap">James Otis</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>A "down-east" plucky lad who ships as cabin boy, not from
love of adventure, but because it is the only course remaining by
which he can gain a livelihood. While in his bunk, seasick,
Ned Rogers hears the captain and mate discussing their plans for
the willful wreck of the brig in order to gain the insurance. Once
it is known he is in possession of the secret the captain maroons
him on Spider Island, explaining to the crew that the boy is
afflicted with leprosy. While thus involuntarily playing the part
of a Crusoe, Ned discovers a wreck submerged in the sand, and
overhauling the timbers for the purpose of gathering material
with which to build a hut finds a considerable amount of treasure.
Raising the wreck; a voyage to Havana under sail; shipping there
a crew and running for Savannah; the attempt of the crew to
seize the little craft after learning of the treasure on board, and,
as a matter of course, the successful ending of the journey, all
serve to make as entertaining a story of sea-life as the most
captious boy could desire.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Geoff and Jim</b>: A Story of School Life. By <span class="smcap">Ismay Thorn</span>. Illustrated
by <span class="smcap">A. G. Walker</span>. 12mo, cloth, price 75 cents.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"This is a prettily told story of the life spent by two motherless bairns at
a small preparatory school. Both Geoff and Jim are very lovable characters,
only Jim is the more so; and the scrapes he gets into and the trials he endures
will, no doubt, interest a large circle of young readers."&mdash;<i>Church
Times.</i></p>

<p>"This is a capital children's story, the characters well portrayed, and the
book tastefully bound and well illustrated."&mdash;<i>Schoolmaster.</i></p>

<p>"The story can be heartily recommended as a present for boys."&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>The Castaways</b>; or, On the Florida Reefs. By <span class="smcap">James Otis</span>.
12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>This tale smacks of the salt sea. It is just the kind of story
that the majority of boys yearn for. From the moment that the
Sea Queen dispenses with the services of the tug in lower New
York bay till the breeze leaves her becalmed off the coast of
Florida, one can almost hear the whistle of the wind through her
rigging, the creak of her straining cordage as she heels to the
leeward, and feel her rise to the snow-capped waves which her
sharp bow cuts into twin streaks of foam. Off Marquesas Keys
she floats in a dead calm. Ben Clark, the hero of the story, and
Jake, the cook, spy a turtle asleep upon the glassy surface of the
water. They determine to capture him, and take a boat for that
purpose, and just as they succeed in catching him a thick fog
cuts them off from the vessel, and then their troubles begin.
They take refuge on board a drifting hulk, a storm arises and they
are cast ashore upon a low sandy key. Their adventures from
this point cannot fail to charm the reader. As a writer for young
people Mr. Otis is a prime favorite. His style is captivating, and
never for a moment does he allow the interest to flag. In "The
Castaways" he is at his best.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Tom Thatcher's Fortune.</b> By <span class="smcap">Horatio Alger, Jr.</span> 12mo,
cloth, price $1.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>Like all of Mr. Alger's heroes, Tom Thatcher is a brave, ambitious,
unselfish boy. He supports his mother and sister on
meager wages earned as a shoe-pegger in John Simpson's factory.
The story begins with Tom's discharge from the factory, because
Mr. Simpson felt annoyed with the lad for interrogating him too
closely about his missing father. A few days afterward Tom
learns that which induces him to start overland for California with
the view of probing the family mystery. He meets with many adventures.
Ultimately he returns to his native village, bringing consternation
to the soul of John Simpson, who only escapes the consequences
of his villainy by making full restitution to the man
whose friendship he had betrayed. The story is told in that entertaining
way which has made Mr. Alger's name a household
word in so many homes.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
